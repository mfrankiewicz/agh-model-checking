This directory contains a derived version of the Boehm-Demers garbage
collector package (version 7.6.4), which will allow the "-gc" options of 
"caesar" and "lotos.open" to work properly.

The Boehm-Demers garbage collector is a conservative (possibly incremental/
generational) garbage collecting storage allocator that is intended to be 
used as a plug-in replacement for C's malloc. For detailed information, see
	http://www.hboehm.info/gc/

For the associated copyright notice, see the credits section in the 
$CADP/README file.

This directory contains for each architecture $ARCH currently supported
(see the list of supported architectures in the INSTALLATION_2 file), a 
sub-directory named bin.$ARCH that contains the GC library (named libgc.a)
compiled for architecture $ARCH.
