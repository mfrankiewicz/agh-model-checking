(*
 * Step 1:
 * -------
 * The LOTOS specification of the dynamic reconfiguration protocol "SPEC.lotos"
 * is compiled using the CAESAR.ADT and CAESAR compilers. The generated
 * labelled transition system is named "SPEC.bcg".
 *)

"SPEC.bcg" = generation of "SPEC.lotos";

(*
 * Step 2:
 * -------
 * "SPEC.bcg" is minimized modulo strong equivalence. This generates the file
 * "SPEC_strong.bcg".
 *)

"SPEC_strong.bcg" = strong reduction of "SPEC.bcg";
