This directory contains an example which explains how the C code 
automatically generated by CAESAR.ADT can be used. A direct application 
is testing: by executing this C code, one can check if the equations given
in the LOTOS specification are correct. But other applications are possible.

CAESAR.ADT automatically translates the abstract data types defined in
the LOTOS specification into equivalent C types and functions. 
It generates a '.h' file which can be included with hand-written C programs. 

An example of such a user program is given in file 'user.c'. It tries
to check whether the abstract data type definitions are correct.

Typing the UNIX command:

$	make

compiles everything and runs the executable program contained in file 'user'.

NB: note that the equations that define the 'eq' operator in type 
    'NATURAL' were modified to avoid 'n eq m = m eq n'. Otherwise 
    the C code generated by CAESAR.ADT would enter into an infinite 
    loop.
