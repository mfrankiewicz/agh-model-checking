This directory contains an example which explains how it is possible to
check the correctness of LOTOS data type definitions, simply by taking
advantage of the control part of LOTOS (without having to write C code 
by hand, as in the `list' demo example given elsewhere).

The basic idea is to compute the results of various value-expressions and to
emit these results on a LOTOS gate (which is called PRINT in the example).

The whole verification scenario is described and commented in the file 
"demo.svl". It can be executed by typing:
$       svl demo
or even simply
$       svl

After execution of the SVL scenario, all generated files can be removed by 
typing
$       svl -clean demo
or even simply
$       svl -clean

NB: More sophisticated LOTOS behaviour-expressions could be used in order to
    achieve better testing of the data types. For instance, it is possible
    to compute the values F(X) for some function F, where X describes all
    values in the domain of a sort S:
         choice X:S [] PRINT !X !F(X); stop
    or to find all values of X for which a given condition holds:
         PRINT ?X:S [F(X) eq G(X)]; stop

NB: note that the equations that define the 'eq' operator in type 
    'NATURAL' were modified to avoid 'n eq m = m eq n'. Otherwise
    the C code generated by CAESAR.ADT would enter into an infinite 
    loop
