This directory contains a collection of BCG graphs to be displayed using
the "bcg_draw" tool.

These graphs can be displayed by typing, under X-windows, the command:
$	./show
which invokes "bcg_draw" internally.

It is also possible to display selectively the graphs with the names 
A*.bcg, B*.bcg, etc. by typing the commands:
$	./show A
$	./show B
etc.
