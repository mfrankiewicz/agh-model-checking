The following parts belong to it:

1. The simulation itself:
         tksim_9		;Main program
	 simmotion.tcl		;Procedures for the motion and management
	 siminit.tcl		;initial graphic procedures
	 siminterface.tcl	;controlling procedures
	 simmath.tcl		;mathematical procedures
     	 simcoltab_cl.tcl	;color values for color diplay
	 simcoltab_bw.tcl	;color values for monochrome display
	 simerrors_eng.tcl	;english error messages 
	 simerrors_grm.tcl	;german error messages
	 simname_eng.tcl	;device names english
	 simname_grm.tcl	;device names german
	 bitmap_grey.xbm 	;containing the grey pattern which is used
				 to draw the table in monochrome mode
       
2. The control panel:
	 panel			;main program
	 panel_grm.tcl		;build the german control panel
	 panel_eng.tcl		;build the english control panel
	 simcoltab_cl.tcl	;color values for color diplay
	 simcoltab_bw.tcl	;color values for monochrome display
  
   NOTE: panel also uses the same simcoltab_ files like the simulation


3. The connection program:
	feedback_pipe 		;reads commands from stdin and send them to
				 the simulation

4. The simulation startprogram:
	startsimu		;starts the simulation and build up all the 
				 necessary connections

All programs are written using Tk/Tcl.



   Starting the simulation
   -----------------------
To start the simulation with the control panel just enter :  startsimu

To start the simulation with your own controller enter:

	startsimu -con controllername

 where "controllername" is the name of your controller.

The following parameters are also available:

	-snc ;which causes the simulation to run in the synchrone mode,
	      which means the controller have to send a "react" command
	      after each command 


	-eng ;to start the simulation using english language

	-grm ;to start the simulation using german  language

	-bw  ;the simulation starts in the monochrome mode 

	-def ;the simulation starts in a defined state :
		-both arms are retracted,
		-the robot's angle is 50, so it can reach the table,
		-the table is in bottom position and has an angle of 0 degrees,
		-the press is in the middle position,
		-the crane is over the deposit belt and it's magnet can 
		 reach for a blank on the belt.

	When using option -snc, if option -def is absent, the initial state is
	defined as follows:
                -both arms are retracted,
                -the robot's angle is 0,
                -the table is in bottom position and has an angle of 0 degrees,
                -the press is in the middle position,
                -the crane is undefined and its magnet is off,
		-the magnets of both arms of the robot are off.
