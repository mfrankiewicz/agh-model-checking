This directory contains an example for BCG_MIN, CAESAR, CAESAR.ADT,
BCG_STEADY, DETERMINATOR, EVALUATOR, CUNCTATOR, LNT2LOTOS, and SVL.
It describes the formal specification (both in LNT and LOTOS), the
model-checking verification and performance evaluation for the
SCSI-2 bus arbitration protocol.

This example is presented in:
   Hubert Garavel and Holger Hermanns. On Combining Functional
   Verification and Performance Evaluation using CADP.
   Proceedings of the 11th International Symposium of Formal
   Methods Europe FME 2002 (Copenhagen, Denmark), LNCS 2391,

In 2016, the specification was translated to LNT by Frederic Lang. The
original LOTOS specification was kept in directory LOTOS.

The functional verification and performance evaluation of the SCSI example
considers three scenarios, respectively noted `A', `B', and `C'. Each
scenario is described and commented in the file "demo.svl".

This demo recomputes the figures 2 and 3 of the Garavel-Hermanns paper,
with minor differences regarding the number of points, the range of
lambda values, etc. Also, the Determinator tool is used instead of
BCG_MIN to speed up computations: as the model generated by Determinator
is already a minimized Continuous-Time Markov Chain, it is no longer
needed to apply BCG_MIN for minimization. This reduces the execution time
by a factor of 8.
