          CADP (CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF DISTRIBUTED PROCESSES)

		   ASSISTED INSTALLATION PROCEDURE

	This document is intended to persons in charge of installing or
upgrading the CADP software, which is distributed electronically using 
Internet protocols FTP and HTTP.

******************************************************************************
 
        If you are planning to use CADP on a PC running Windows, you should
read first the instructions for setting up your PC in order to run CADP.
These instructions are given in file $CADP/INSTALLATION_WINDOWS. They are 
also available on the Web from: 
	http://cadp.inria.fr/win32.html 

        If you are planning to use CADP on an Apple computer running macOS,
you should read first the instructions for setting up your computer in order
to run CADP. These instructions are given in file $CADP/INSTALLATION_MACOS.
They are also available on the Web from: 
	http://cadp.inria.fr/macOS.html 

******************************************************************************

	The installation of CADP can be greatly simplified by the use of
Installator, the CADP Installation Assistant. Installator is a user-friendly
program which will help you to install or upgrade CADP. It will automatically
download and configure the CADP software on your machine(s).

	Alternately, there is also a manual installation procedure for CADP
(see the $CADP/INSTALLATION_4 for CADP), which is more complex and, therefore,
not recommended unless required by some specific circumstances. In most cases
however, the assisted installation procedure should be preferred.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1) Make sure that you are in possession of the password required for
   downloading the latest version of the CADP. This password should have 
   been sent to you by the CADP development team. If you do not have it, 
   please enquire by sending an e-mail to "cadp@inria.fr".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Please note that the whole CADP software is entirely contained in a 
   single directory. There is no constraint on the location of this directory:
   you can install it any place on any filesystem (provided that there is
   sufficient disk space). 

   On Windows, however, it is highly recommended to install CADP in C:\cadp,
   assuming that Windows and Cygwin are also installed on drive C. All the
   CADP tools should be executed in working directories located on this drive.

   On a local area network, it is advised to have only a single installed copy
   of the CADP software, which is exported and made visible to other machines
   by means of mounted filesystems (e.g., using NFS). This functioning mode
   is permitted by the software licensing scheme used by the CADP software.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) On Unix-based systems (namely, Solaris, Linux, and macOS), it is not
   necessary to be an a super-user ("root") to install or upgrade the CADP
   software. We even recommend that you install it as an ordinary user (not
   "root"). However, you may also need super-user privilege to install some
   additional software (e.g., Gnuplot) suitable for using all functionalities
   of CADP.

   On Windows systems, you will need administrator privileges to install both
   the Cygwin software and the CADP software. In particular, you must install
   CADP from a Cygwin shell window launched with administrative privileges
   (right-click on the Cygwin icon and select "Run as Administrator").

   In any case, if a copy of CADP already exists on your system, you will need
   to be the owner of the directory containing CADP (including all its files
   and sub-directories) to perform the upgrade.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) There are two possible ways to start the assisted installation procedure:

	- The first way is only applicable if you have already a copy of the
	  CADP software installed on your machine, and if this copy is more
	  recent than CADP version 2006-a.

	  If this is the case, determine the directory $CADP in which your
	  copy is installed. Then, you simply have to type the following
	  shell-command:

		"$CADP"/com/installator

   	  or, in the particular case where you are looking for a beta-release
	  of CADP rather than an official release:

		"$CADP"/com/installator -beta

	  Do not use the -beta option unless you have been specifically 
	  advised to do so by the CADP development team.

   	  This command will start Installator, which will help you to install
	  or upgrade CADP on your machine(s). Please note that you will be
	  prompted the download password to proceed.

	- The second way is always applicable: it works both for first-time 
	  installations and for upgrades of existing copies (whatever their 
	  version numbers). Use your favourite Web browser to access the
          following URL:
		http://cadp.inria.fr/installator
   	  and follow the explanations given.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5) Once you have downloaded the latest version of CADP, please remember that:

	- All CADP users should customize their startup files as explained
	  in the $CADP/INSTALLATION_2 file.
 
	- You will have to install the $CADP/LICENSE file that will be
	  returned to you by e-mail (for detailed information about the
	  licensing scheme, consult the $CADP/INSTALLATION_3 file).
