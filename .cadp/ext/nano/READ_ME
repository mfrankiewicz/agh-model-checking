How to use these files:
-----------------------

Then, in your home directory, create a ".nanorc" file if it does not exist
already. Insert the following lines in this file, replacing each occurrence
of PATH_TO_CADP with the absolute path where the CADP software is installed
on your machine (i.e., the value of the $CADP environment variable):

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
