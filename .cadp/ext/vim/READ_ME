-- CADP (CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF DISTRIBUTED PROCESSES)
-- http://cadp.inria.fr

This directory contains the following files:

 - cadp.vimrc:      main entry point giving access to all CADP languages

 - bes.vim:         Vim syntax mode for the BES format
 - exp.vim:         Vim syntax mode for the EXP format
 - lnt.vim:         Vim syntax mode for the LNT language
 - lotos.vim:       Vim syntax mode for the LOTOS language
 - mcl.vim:         Vim syntax mode for the MCL language
 - nupn.vim:        Vim syntax mode for the NUPN format
 - rbc.vim:         Vim syntax mode for the RBC format
 - svl.vim:         Vim syntax mode for the SVL language
 - xtl.vim:         Vim syntax mode for the XTL language

These files were found to work properly with Vim 7.2 and 7.3.

Notice that the local file "lotos.vim" supersedes the (older) syntax
mode for LOTOS present in the official Vim distributions.

How to use these files:
-----------------------

Type the following shell commands:

	mkdir -p $HOME/.vim/syntax
	ln -s $CADP/ext/vim/*.vim $HOME/.vim/syntax

where $CADP is the pathname of the directory in which the CADP software
is installed on your machine.

Then, in your home directory, create a ".vimrc" file if it does not exist
already. Insert the following line in this file:

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

source $CADP/ext/vim/cadp.vimrc
