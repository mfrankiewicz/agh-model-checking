This directory contains the following files:

 - bes.ssh:         a2ps filter for the BES format
 - lnt.ssh:         a2ps filter for the LNT language
 - lotos.ssh:       a2ps filter for the LOTOS language
 - mcl.ssh:         a2ps filter for the MCL language
 - nupn.ssh:        a2ps filter for the NUPN format
 - rbc.ssh:         a2ps filter for the RBC format
 - svl.ssh:         a2ps filter for the SVL language
 - xtl.ssh:         a2ps filter for the XTL language

Note : Before CADP 2015-l (included), this directory used to contain two files:
"lotos.ssh" and "lnt.ssh", two a2ps filters developed by Etienne Lantreibecq
and Remi Herilier. Both files are superseded by the current files.

How to use these files:
-----------------------

We assume that the GNU a2ps software, which converts text into PostScript is
already installed on your machine (see http://www.gnu.org/software/a2ps).

1) If you do not already have a ".a2ps" directory in your $HOME directory
   create it.

2) If your $HOME/.a2ps directory does not contain a file named "a2psrc",
   create an empty file having this name.

3) At the end of your $HOME/.a2ps/a2psrc file, append the following line
      PrependLibraryPath: $CADP/ext/a2ps
   where $CADP should be replaced by the absolute pathname of the directory
   in which the CADP software is installed.

4) If your $HOME/.a2ps directory does not contain a file named "sheets.map"
   locate this file in the a2ps installation directory (e.g., by running the
   command "locate a2ps/sheets/sheets.map") and copy it into $HOME/.a2ps.

5) At the end of your $HOME/.a2ps/sheets.map, append the following lines:
