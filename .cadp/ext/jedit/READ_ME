This directory contains the following files:

 - bes.xml:         jEdit syntax mode for the BES format
 - exp.xml:         jEdit syntax mode for the EXP format
 - lnt.xml:         jEdit syntax mode for the LNT language
 - lotos.xml:       jEdit syntax mode for the LOTOS language
 - mcl.xml:         jEdit syntax mode for the MCL language
 - nupn.xml:        jEdit syntax mode for the NUPN format
 - rbc.xml:         jEdit syntax mode for the RBC format
 - svl.xml:         jEdit syntax mode for the SVL language
 - xtl.xml:         jEdi syntax mode for the XTL language

The file "lotosnt.xml" is a symbolic link kept for backward compatibility.

Note: Before CADP 2015-j (included), this directory used to contain two files:
"lotos.xml", a jEdit mode for LOTOS developed by Ken Turner, and "lnt.xml",
a jEdit mode for LNT developed by Yves Guerte, Hubert Garavel, and Frederic
Lang. Both files, which were found to work properly for jEdit version 4.1,
are superseded by the current files.

How to use these files:
-----------------------

1) If you have never invoked jEdit previously, launch it. This will create
   a ".jedit" directory in your $HOME directory. This ".jedit" directory
   should itself contain a "modes" sub-directory.

2) Type the following command to create symbolic links:

     ln -s "$CADP"/ext/jedit/*.xml   "$HOME"/.jedit/modes/

  where $CADP is the pathname of the directory in which the CADP software
  is installed on your machine.

3) Edit the file $HOME/.jedit/modes/catalog and insert the following
   lines between <MODES> and </MODES>:
