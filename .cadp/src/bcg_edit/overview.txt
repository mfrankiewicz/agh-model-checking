BCG_EDIT is an user-friendly, TCL-TK based, graphical editor, which 
allows to modify interactively the representation of the Labelled 
Transition Systems contained in BCG files.

BCG_EDIT works on files encoded using the BCG PostScript Format. 
This format specifies at once the logical structure and the graphical 
representation of BCG graphs using the PostScript language.
