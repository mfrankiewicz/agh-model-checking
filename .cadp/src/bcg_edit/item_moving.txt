+-------------+

The following items can be moved:

   - vertices,

   - control points of (symmetrical and asymmetrical) curved edges
     and loops

   - edge labels (these labels can be moved anywhere on their edges,
     to which they always remain attached)

Moving an item can be done by simple clicking on it with the left
button, dragging it to a new position and releasing the button.

Note: on slow computers, moving labels on curved edges can take some
time, because it involves spline discretization. Reducing the value of
the environment variable $BCG_EDIT_SPLINE_STEPS may avoid the problem.
