The "File name" entry works as a pattern-matching filter, following
the "glob" conventions of he C-shell "csh". For example, the pattern
"*.ps" will select all files having a ".ps" extension and the pattern 
"*.bcg" will elect all files having a ".bcg" extension. It is also
possible to type directly a new file name (or pattern) in this field.

The "Directory" entry displays the current directory path. It can be 
modified directly, by typing the new directory path in this field.

The list below shows the directories and the files that match the current
pattern. Directories and files can be selected with a simple click of
the left button: 

	- Clicking on a directory makes to enter this directory. 
          The ".." entry corresponds to the parent directory in the 
          file system hierarchy. A simple 

        - Clicking on a file selects this file for loading or saving
          (see below).

The "Load" or "Save" button allows to read or write into the selected
file.

The "Refresh" button consults the contents of the current directory
and updates the list.

The "Cancel" button allows to quit the file browser, leaving the
current directory unchanged.
