| Item alignment |
+----------------+

Before using the "Align horizontally" and "Align vertically" commands 
of the "Edit" menu), it is necessary to select a group of vertices.

This can be done by simultaneously pressing the <Shift> key,
clicking with any button to delimit one corner of the selection
box, dragging the mouse, and clicking again to delimit the 
second corner of the selection box. The selected vertices 
will appear drawn in black.
