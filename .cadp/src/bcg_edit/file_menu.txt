"Load PS ..."  
-------------
Opens a file browser for selecting which file to read. This file should
be readable, have a ".ps" extension, and be encoded using the BCG
PostScript Format. 

If another graph was already under edition and not saved yet, BCG_EDIT 
will warn that modifications are lost if a new file is loaded.

CAUTION! A PostScript file under edition with BCG_EDIT must never be 
removed or otherwise altered before it is saved (because BCG_EDIT
needs to read again the file before saving it). Otherwise, BCG_EDIT
will be unable to save the modifications.

"Load BCG ..."  
--------------
Opens a file browser for selecting which file to read. This file should
be readable, have a ".bcg" extension, and be encoded using the BCG 
Format. 

BCG_EDIT will silently invoke BCG_DRAW in order to produce a PostScript
file from the BCG file. This PostScript file will have the same file name
as the BCG file, with a different extension (".ps" instead of ".bcg").
If a PostScript file with this name already exists, BCG_EDIT will ask
if it can be overwritten.

If another graph was already under edition and not saved yet, BCG_EDIT 
will warn that modifications are lost if a new file is loaded.

CAUTION! A PostScript file under edition with BCG_EDIT must never be 
removed or otherwise altered before it is saved (because BCG_EDIT
needs to read again the file before saving it). Otherwise, BCG_EDIT
will be unable to save the modifications.

"Save PS"
---------
Saves the graph currently edited in the last ".ps" file loaded. This 
file should be writable. It will be encoded using the BCG PostScript 
Format. 

"Save PS as ..."
----------------
Opens a file browser for selecting which file to write. This file should
be writable and have a ".ps" extension. It will be encoded using the BCG
Postcript Format.

"Preview ..."                        
-------------
Displays the graph using a PostScript previewer. A dialog box is opened
to select which previewer to use. The default previewer name is stored in 
the environment variable $CADP_PS_VIEWER.

"Print ..."
-----------
Prints the graph on a PostScript printer. A dialog box is opened to
select which printer to use. The default printer name is stored in the 
environment variable $PRINTER.

"Quit ..."                                                    
----------
Exits BCG_EDIT. If a graph was under edition and not saved yet, BCG_EDIT 
will warn that modifications are lost upon quit.
