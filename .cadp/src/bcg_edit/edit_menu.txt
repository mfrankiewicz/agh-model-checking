"Refresh"
---------
Refreshs the window. This may be useful if the window manager fails
to do it automatically.
              
"Active the grid"
-----------------
If this switch is on, all items will be aligned with the grid when 
they are moved. Otherwise, items are not aligned with the grid. 
The grid size might be modified (see the command "Display options..."
in the "Options..." menu).

"Active arrow auto-scale"
-------------------------
If this switch is on, the edge arrows might be scaled automatically 
(i.e., their size might be reduced) when vertices are moved. This
occurs whenever the origin vertice and target vertice of an edge
are moved so close one from the otehr that the distance between
those two vertices becomes less than the ARROW_SHAPE_1 constant.
In such case, the size of the arrow is reduced to fit the available
space. 

This scheme works well for straight edges. However, for asymmetrical 
curved edges, an approximation is used that might scale the arrows
even if it is not needed actually. Should this happen, the user can 
always edit and modify each arrow individually (see the informations
about "Edge editing").

If this switch is off, the shapes and sizes of the edges are not 
modified when vertices are moved.

"Hide all control points"
-------------------------
Removes all control points of the displayed items. Control points can 
also be removed individually by double clicking on them with the left 
button.

"Show all control points"
-------------------------
Shows all the control points of the displayed items.
   
"Align horizontally"
--------------------
Aligns horizontally a group of selected vertices (taking for reference
the vertice with the lowest state number). See "Item alignment" to learn
about vertex selection.
        
"Align vertically"
------------------
Aligns vertically a group of selected vertices (taking for reference
the vertice with the lowest state number). See "Item alignment" to learn
about vertex selection.
