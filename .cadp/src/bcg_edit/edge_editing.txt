BCG_EDIT knows four kinds of edges:

     - straight edges
     - symmetrical curved edges
     - asymmetrical curved edges
     - loops

(see the BCG PostScript Format for more information).

Modifying the shape of an edge
------------------------------
A single left button click on an edge (or its label) displays the control 
points of the edge (except in the case of straight edges, for which
there are no control points). 

Using the first button, these control points can be moved in order 
to change the appearance of the edge. For loops, there is a single
control point, which allows to strecht the loop, and rotate it around 
the vertex at once.

A double left button click on these control points removes them. 

Modifying the type of an edge
-----------------------------
The type of an edge can be changed. For example, a straight edge can be
changed into a symmetrical curved edge or an asymmetrical curved edge. 

A single right button click on an edge (or its label) opens a window 
allowing to choose the type of the edge. You can either modify the type 
or keep it unchanged by pressing the "Cancel" button.

A single middle button click is a shortcut for transforming edges:

     - on straight edge (or its label): 
       the edge is changed into a symmetrical curved edge;

     - on symmetrical curved edge (or its label): 
       the edge is changed into a straight edge or a loop;

     - on asymmetrical curved edge (or its label):
       the edge is changed into a straight edge or a loop;

     - on a loop (or its label):
       the edge is changed into a symmetrical curved edge.

Modifying the arrow scale factor
--------------------------------
This can be done by simultaneously pressing the <Control> key
and clicking with the left button click on an edge (or its label).
A dialog window opens, which allows to modify the scale of the
edge's arrow.
