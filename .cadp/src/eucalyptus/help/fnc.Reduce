Reduce allows the minimization of a Labelled Transition system according
to various equivalences (e.g., strong equivalence, branching bisimulation,
safety equivalence, etc.). 

This functionality can also be used to compare ``on the fly'' a network of 
communicating Labelled Transition systems to another Labelled Transition 
system.
