-- CADP (CONSTRUCTION AND ANALYSIS OF DISTRIBUTED PROCESSES)
-- http://cadp.inria.fr

This directory contains the CADP manual pages in various formats.

	* Directory "manl" contains the original manual pages written in
	  UNIX "nroff -man" format. For each CADP command named COMMAND, 
	  the corresponding manual page is contained in the file named
	  "manl/COMMAND.l".

	  To read the manual page for command COMMAND, the simplest way is 
	  to set the environment variable $MANPATH as explained in file 
	  $CADP/INSTALLATION_2 and to type:
		man COMMAND

	  A more pleasant result can be achieved by setting the environment 
	  variable $PAGER to "less" ("less" is a GNU replacement for "more"), 
	  or by typing: 
		ul $CADP/man/catl/COMMAND.l | more -f -s 

	* Directory "catl" contains the pre-processed manual pages generated
	  by the UNIX catman(1) tool from the pages contained in directory 
	  "manl".

	* Directory "html" contains the same manual pages in HTML format.

	* Directory "pdf" contains the same manual pages in Abobe's PDF format.

	* Files "whatis" and "windex" contains the cross-index generated by 
	  the catman(1) command.
