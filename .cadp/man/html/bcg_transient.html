<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#sect2">Description</A></H2>
<B>bcg_transient</B> performs transient analysis on <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B>, which
is an (extended) continuous-time Markov chain encoded in the BCG format.
<P>
<B>bcg_transient</B> first transforms <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B> into a numerical matrix indexed
by states. Then, it reduces this matrix by normalizing probabilistic transitions,
removing unreachable states and "vanishing" states, keeping "tangible"
states only (see section INPUT below for details about the BCG graphs accepted
by <B>bcg_transient</B> and the definition of tangible and  vanishing states).
As a result, the reduced matrix obtained is the generator matrix of a continuous-time
Markov chain. Finally, <B>bcg_transient</B> computes the time-dependent ("transient")
probability  distribution of the model at several (user-specified) time
instants using the uniformization algorithm [Jen53] (and the Fox-Glynn method
[FG88] to approximate Poisson probabilities). It can also compute throughputs
for the transitions of the system. 
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#sect3">General Options</A></H2>
The following <I>bcg_options</I>
are currently supported: <B>-version</B>,  <B>-create</B>, <B>-update</B>, <B>-remove</B>, <B>-cc</B>, and <B>-tmp</B>.
See the <A HREF="bcg.html"><B>bcg</B></A>
 manual page for a description of these options. 
<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#sect4">Particular
Options</A></H2>
Taking as input <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B>, on the form of which various restrictions
apply (see section INPUT below), and a list of  <I>time_instant</I>s, <B>bcg_transient</B>
can produce five kinds of output files, depending on the command-line options
specified.  <P>
The optional list of "<I>parameter</I>=<I>value</I>" arguments at the end
of the command-line (where <I>parameter</I> is any character string that neither
contain blanks nor the "=" character, and where <I>value</I> is any character
string that does not contain blanks) is only meaningful to option <B>-thr</B>. These
arguments have no influence on the actual numerical computations, they
only serve to add columns in throughput tables (see section OUTPUT-2 below).
<P>
Time is a special parameter that can be dealt with using the (optional)
argument "<CODE>time</CODE>=<CODE>here</CODE>", whose meaning is detailed in section OUTPUT-2 below.
When <I>parameter</I> is equal to "<CODE>time</CODE>", <I>value</I> must be equal to the keyword "<CODE>here</CODE>".
<P>
The <I>time_instant</I>s are strictly positive real numbers, and there must be
at least one <I>time_instant</I>. <P>
The following options are supported: 
<DL><DD><DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>-epsilon</B><I>&nbsp;eps</I>
</DT>
<DD>Set the precision of certain floating-point comparisons to <I>eps</I>, where <I>eps</I>
is a real value. When <I>eps</I> is out of [0..1[, <B>bcg_transient</B> reports an error.
Default value for <I>eps</I> is 1E-6. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-sol</B><I>&nbsp;<I>solution_file</I></I> </DT>
<DD>Write the probability vectors,
computed at each of the <I>time_instant</I>s specified on the command-line, to
file <I>solution_file</I> (see section OUTPUT-1 below for a description of the
file format). If <I>solution_file</I> already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
If <I>solution_file</I> is equal to the special string `-', the probability vector
is displayed on the standard output. Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-thr</B><I>&nbsp;[<B>-append</B>]&nbsp;<I>throughput_file</I></I>
</DT>
<DD>Write the transition throughputs, computed at each of the <I>time_instant</I>s
specified on the command-line, to file <I>throughput_file</I>. The format of this
file is determined by the suffix (i.e., file extension) of  <I>throughput_file</I>
(see section OUTPUT-2 below for a description of the available file formats).
If <I>throughput_file</I> already exists, its contents will be overwritten, unless
the <B>-append</B> option is specified, in which case the transition throughputs
will be added at the end of  <I>throughput_file</I> so as to form a proper data
table. If the <B>-thr</B> option is missing or if <I>throughput_file</I> is equal to the
special string `-', the transition throughputs are displayed on the standard
output. Option "<B>-thr -</B>" is the default option when the command line does not
contain any of the following options: <B>-mat</B>, <B>-red</B>, <B>-sol</B>, and <B>-thr</B>. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-mat</B><I>&nbsp;<I>matrix_file</I></I>
</DT>
<DD>Write the "raw" matrix (prior to matrix reduction) to file  <I>matrix_file</I>.
The format of this file is determined by the suffix (i.e., file extension)
of <I>matrix_file</I> (see section OUTPUT-3 below for a description of the available
file formats). If <I>matrix_file</I> already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
If <I>matrix_file</I> is equal to the special string `-', the matrix is displayed
on the standard output. Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-red</B><I>&nbsp;<I>reduced_matrix_file</I></I> </DT>
<DD>Write
the reduced matrix to file <I>reduced_matrix_file</I>. The format of this file
is determined by the suffix (i.e., file extension) of  <I>reduced_matrix_file</I>
(see section OUTPUT-3 below for a description of the available file formats).
If <I>reduced_matrix_file</I> already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
If <I>reduced_matrix_file</I> is equal to the special string `-', the reduced matrix
is written on the standard output. Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-log</B><I>&nbsp;<I>log_file</I></I> </DT>
<DD>Write
various information about data structures and computations to file <I>log_file</I>.
The format of this file is undocumented but self-understandable, and might
change in future releases of <I>bcg_transient</I>. If <I>log_file</I>  already exists,
its contents will be overwritten. If <I>log_file</I> is equal to the special string
`-', information is displayed on the standard output. Not a default option.
</DD><P>
</DL></DD><P></DL>
<P>
The files <I>solution_file</I>, <I>throughput_file</I>, <I>matrix_file</I>, <I>reduced_matrix_file</I>,
and <I>log_file</I> should be pairwise different; otherwise, the result is undefined.

<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#sect5">Input: the BCG Graph</A></H2>
The input of <B>bcg_transient</B> is an extended Markovian
model combining features from discrete-time and continuous-time Markov chains.
In order to be accepted by <B>bcg_transient</B>, <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B> must satisfy several
conditions, otherwise an error message will occur All transition labels
of <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B> must have one of the following forms: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>"<CODE>rate</CODE> <I>%f</I>" (called
a stochastic transition), </LI><P><LI type=disc>"<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate</CODE> <I>%f</I>" (called a labelled stochastic
transition), </LI><P><LI type=disc>"<CODE>prob</CODE> <I>%p</I>" (called a probabilistic transition), or </LI><P><LI type=disc>"<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;prob</CODE>
<I>%p</I>" (called a labelled probabilistic transition) , </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
where <CODE>%f</CODE> denotes a strictly
positive floating-point number,  <CODE>%p</CODE> denotes a floating-point number in the
range ]0..1],  and <I>label</I> denotes a character string that does not contain
the "<CODE>;</CODE>" character (<I>label</I> may be equal to the internal action, often noted
"i" or "tau").  <P>
Note: transitions labelled with only "<I>label</I>" are always
forbidden by <B>bcg_transient</B>, including the case where "<I>label</I>" denotes the
internal action. <P>
When constructing the "raw" matrix, all <I>label</I>s occurring
in labelled probabilistic transitions are discarded. <P>
If there exists a (labelled)
probabilistic transition from a state <I>S1</I> to a state <I>S2</I>, then all (labelled)
stochastic transitions from <I>S1</I> to any state (including <I>S2</I>) are discarded
when constructing the "raw"  matrix. This reflects that probabilistic transitions
are instantaneous, while stochastic transitions are not. <P>
We classify states
as being either <I>vanishing</I> if at least one (possibly labelled) probabilistic
transition goes out of these states, or <I>tangible</I> otherwise. <P>
The input BCG
graph should contain at least one tangible state, and it should not contain
cycles of vanishing states connected by (possibly labelled) probabilistic
transitions. <P>
Note: The sum of <CODE>%p</CODE> values on all (possibly labelled) probabilistic
transitions leaving a vanishing state needs not be equal to 1; if this
sum is different from 1, then probabilistic values will be normalized (i.e.,
divided by this sum). <P>
To build the reduced matrix, <B>bcg_steady</B> eliminates
all vanishing states, so that this matrix contains tangible states only.
<P>
See also <A HREF="bcg_min.html"><B>bcg_min</B></A>
 for a discussion about the various probabilistic
and stochastic models present in the scientific literature. 
<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#sect6">Output-1: the
Solution Vector</A></H2>
The format of the file generated using the <B>-sol</B> option of
<B>bcg_transient</B> is the following. There is one line per time instant and per
tangible state. Each line contains three numbers: a real number giving the
time instant, an integer corresponding to the state number in the input
BCG graph, and a real number corresponding to the probability of being
in this state at that time instant. 
<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#sect7">Output-2: the Transition Throughputs</A></H2>
<P>
The
throughput table has two (possibly empty) groups of columns: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>The first
group contains at least one column for time values, plus one column for
each option <I>parameter</I>=<I>value</I> given on the command-line (except for the "<CODE>time</CODE>=<CODE>here</CODE>"
option, if present, since there is only one single column for time).  These
columns, if any, are useful when evaluating the performance of a system
parameterized with one or more variables, namely to aggregate in the same
table the different throughputs measures corresponding to different time
instants and different values of the parameters. Columns of the first group
appear in the same order as the corresponding options on the command-line.
By default, time appears in the first column, unless the "<CODE>time</CODE>=<CODE>here</CODE>" option
is present, in which case the time column appears at the place specified
by this option.  <BR>
 </LI><P><LI type=disc>The second group contains one column per labelled stochastic transition
label present in the input BCG graph, precisely, one column for each different
<I>label</I> occurring on a transition of the form "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>". </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
The throughput
table starts with a first "header" line followed by one or several "subsequent"
lines. 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>The header line contains the "titles" of columns. For a column of
the first group associated to a <I>parameter</I>=<I>value</I> option, the corresponding
title is <I>parameter</I>, the title of the time column being <CODE>time</CODE>.  For a column
of the second group associated to a label, the corresponding title is the
label itself. </LI><P><LI type=disc>Each of the subsequent lines is associated to a particular
time instant <I>t</I> specified on the command-line and contains values. For a column
of the first group associated to a <I>parameter</I>=<I>value</I> option: if <I>parameter</I>
is equal to <CODE>time</CODE> the corresponding cell contains the value of <I>t</I>; otherwise,
the corresponding cell contains <I>value</I>, which is the same for all time instants.
For a column of the second group associated to a <I>label</I>, the corresponding
cell contains the throughput for this label at time <I>t</I>, i.e., the sum, for
each stochastic transition "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>", of the rate value <I>%f</I> weighted
with the probability of being in the tangible source state of this transition
at time <I>t</I>. </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
If the <B>-append</B> option is absent, or if the throughput file is
equal to the special string `-', or if the throughput file does not exist,
or if it is empty, <I>bcg_transient</I> will generate automatically the header
line and the subsequent lines. <P>
Otherwise, the first line of the throughput
file is expected to contain the titles of columns and will be parsed to
identify the correspondance between labels and columns. In particular, <B>bcg_transient</B>
checks that the first group of columns corresponds to the parameters given
on the command-line. After parsing the header line, <B>bcg_transient</B> will append
the subsequent lines at the end of the throughput file. As regards the second
group of columns, if the label of a given column title does not occur in
<I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B>, a zero throughput will be reported in the corresponding column;
conversely, labels of <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B> for which there is no corresponding column
title will be ignored. <P>
Throughputs can be displayed in two different formats,
which are determined according to the suffix (i.e., file extension) of the
throughput file name. 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>If the file name has the "<B>.csv</B>" extension, the throughput
table will be displayed in the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) exchange format
understood by most relational data base applications and spreadsheet software
(such as Microsoft Excel, etc.). </LI><P><LI type=disc>Otherwise, if the file name has a different
extension, or no extension, or if it is the standard output, throughputs
will be displayed in a human-readable format that is essentially the same
format as CSV with commas replaced by spaces so as to align columns properly.
Note that this format is also understood by some data visualization tools
such as Gnuplot. </LI><P>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#sect8">Output-3: the Matrices</A></H2>
Both the "raw" matrix produced using
option <B>-mat</B> and the reduced  matrix produced using option <B>-red</B> follow the
same format  conventions. The essential difference is that the former contains
vanishing and tangible states, whereas the latter only contains tangible
states. Also, the reduced matrix is a generator of a continuous-time Markov
chain. <P>
For two different indexes <I>i</I> and <I>j</I>, the element (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>) of the matrix,
located at the <I>i</I>-th row and the <I>j</I>-th column, is the sum of all the floating-point
numbers associated to the (labelled) stochastic or probabilistic transitions
going from the <I>j</I>-th state to the <I>i</I>-th state, where floating-point numbers
associated to (labelled) stochastic  transitions are interpreted as positive
numbers whereas floating-point numbers associated to (labelled) probabilistic
transitions are interpreted as negative numbers between -1 and 0. Note that
rates and probabilities are never mixed since, between two states, there
cannot be stochastic and probabilistic transitions at the same time. <P>
The
diagonal elements (<I>i</I>,<I>i</I>) are defined to be the negative sum of all matrix
elements (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>) with <I>j</I> different from <I>i</I>. <P>
Matrices can be displayed in three
different formats, which are determined according to the suffix (i.e., file
extension) of the matrix file name. 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>If the file name has the "<B>.csv</B>" extension,
the matrix will be displayed in the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format
mentioned above. Each raw of the matrix is displayed on one line of the
output file, and on each line, the matrix elements are separated with commas.
</LI><P><LI type=disc>If the file name has the "<B>.spm</B>" extension, the matrix will be displayed
in the format used by the Sparse 1.3 software library (see the CREDITS section
below). This format is the following. The first line of the file contains
the file name. The second line contains the number of states, followed by
the "<CODE>real</CODE>" keyword. Then, there is one line per each non-zero element (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>)
in the matrix. Each line contains two integers followed by one real number:
the value of <I>i</I>, the value of <I>j</I>, and the value of matrix element (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>). The
file ends with a "sentinel" line consisting of three zeros. </LI><P><LI type=disc>Otherwise, if
the file name has a different extension, or no extension, or if it is the
standard output, the matrix will be displayed in a human-readable format.
The columns of the matrix are split into "packets" so that the text fits
on the size of the display. The indexes of rows and columns are indicated
and null elements of the matrix are displayed as "..." instead of "0". Statistics
(such as matrix size, density, etc.), are displayed after the matrix. </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
Note:
for graphs with many states, whatever the chosen matrix format, the matrix
files can be large and writing them to disk may take time.

The first version of <B>bcg_transient</B> was
written by Christophe Joubert  (INRIA/VASY) and Holger Hermanns (Saarland
University and University of  Twente). The algorithm for uniformization
is based on a former implementation by Vassilis Mertsiotakis (University
of Erlangen). Bruno Ondet (INRIA/VASY) ported the tool to various architectures.
David Champelovier and Hubert  Garavel (both at INRIA/VASY) deeply revised
the <B>bcg_transient</B>  code and manual page to allow their integration within
CADP. Holger Hermanns and Frederic Lang (INRIA/VASY) proof-checked the manual
page. 
<H2><A NAME="sect12" HREF="#sect12">Credits</A></H2>
<B>bcg_transient</B> uses (an extended version of) the Sparse 1.3 package
from the University of California, Berkeley, developed by Kenneth S. Kundert
under the supervision of Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli.
