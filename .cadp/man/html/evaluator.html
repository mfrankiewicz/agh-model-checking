evaluator - a family of on-the-fly model checkers 
<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#sect1">Description</A></H2>
<B>evaluator</B>
denotes a family of on-the-fly model checkers of CADP based on the modal
mu-calculus. These tools take as inputs a Labelled Transition System (LTS)
and a temporal logic formula, and produce as output a verdict indicating
whether the LTS satisfies the formula or not, optionally accompanied by
a diagnostic (fragment of the LTS) illustrating the verdict. <P>
On the theoretical
side, these model checkers rely on the resolution of Boolean Equation Systems
(BES), Parameterized Boolean Equation Systems (PBES), and Linear Equation
Systems (LES). On the practical side, they are implemented using the OPEN/CAESAR
framework of CADP for on-the-fly verification. <P>
Three versions of <B>evaluator</B>
are currently available: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc><B>evaluator3 (see the</B> <A HREF="evaluator3.html"><B>evaluator3</B></A>
 manual page)
is an on-the-fly model checker for <I>MCL</I> version 3, an extension of the alternation-free
mu-calculus with action predicates and regular expressions over action sequences.
In the temporal formulas of <I>MCL</I> version 3, LTS actions are merely character
strings. See the <A HREF="mcl3.html"><B>mcl3</B></A>
 manual page for details. <P>
</LI><P><LI type=disc><B>evaluator4 (see the</B>
<A HREF="evaluator4.html"><B>evaluator4</B></A>
 manual page) is an on-the-fly model checker for <I>MCL</I> version
4, an extension of <I>MCL</I> version 3 with data-handling constructs (data variables,
expressions, parameterized fixed point operators, programming language
constructs) and an infinite looping operator able to express fairness properties.
In the temporal formulas of <I>MCL</I> version 4, LTS actions are tuples containing
channel names and data values, which can be extracted and used in calculations.
See the <A HREF="mcl4.html"><B>mcl4</B></A>
 manual page for details. </LI><P><LI type=disc><B>evaluator5 (see the</B> <A HREF="evaluator5.html"><B>evaluator5</B></A>

manual page) is an on-the-fly model checker for <I>MCL</I> version 5, an extension
of <I>MCL</I> version 4 with a probabilistic operator specifying the probability
of transition sequences characterized by generalized regular formulas. This
probabilistic operator is interpreted on Probabilistic Transition Systems
(PTSs), which are LTSs whose actions contain channel names, data values,
and probabilities. See the <A HREF="mcl5.html"><B>mcl5</B></A>
 manual page for details. </LI><P>

Note: Currently,
for backward compatibility reasons, <B>evaluator</B> (located in <B>$CADP/bin.*/evaluator.a</B>)
is a shorthand for <B>evaluator3</B> (located in <B>$CADP/bin.*/evaluator3.a</B>). 
<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#sect2">History
and Authors</A></H2>
Versions 1.x and 2.x of EVALUATOR were developed by Marius Dorel
Bozga (IMAG) and used an on-the-fly BES resolution algorithm proposed by
J-C. Fernandez and L. Mounier. These versions, which accepted as input alternation-free
modal mu-calculus (without regular expressions), are no longer available.
<P>
Version 3.0 of EVALUATOR was developed by Radu Mateescu and Mihaela Sighireanu
(both at INRIA/VASY) and used a completely new on-the-fly BES resolution
algorithm. Hubert Garavel (INRIA/VASY) suggested the enhancement of action
formulas with the string concatenation operator, which was implemented
by David Champelovier (INRIA/VASY). <P>
Versions 3.5 and 3.6 of EVALUATOR replaced
the dedicated BES resolution algorithm by the more general algorithms available
in the <A HREF="caesar_solve_1.html"><B>caesar_solve_1</B></A>
 library of OPEN/CAESAR for on-the-fly BES resolution.
All of this was implemented by Radu Mateescu (INRIA/VASY). <P>
Version 4.0 of
EVALUATOR handles version 4 of the <I>MCL</I> language. It was implemented by Radu
Mateescu and Damien Thivolle (both at INRIA/VASY). <P>
Version 5.0 of EVALUATOR
handles version 5 of the <I>MCL</I> language. It was implemented by Radu Mateescu
(INRIA/CONVECS).
