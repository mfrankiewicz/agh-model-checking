<B>bcg_min</B> takes
as input the BCG graph <I>input</I><B>.bcg</B>, minimizes this graph according to some
bisimulation relation, and writes the resulting reduced graph to <I>output</I><B>.bcg</B>,

<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#sect2">Description</A></H2>
<B>bcg_min</B> implements
various algorithms to perform minimization of graphs encoded in the BCG
format according to strong bisimulation, branching bisimulation, divergence-sensitive
branching bisimulation, or observational equivalence. A graph input or output
by <B>bcg_min</B> can be: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>either a "normal" LTS, whose transitions are either
labelled with "normal" labels or with the "internal" label (usually noted
"tau" in the scientific  literature and displayed as the character string
"<CODE>i</CODE>" by the various  BCG tools), </LI><P><LI type=disc>or a "probabilistic LTS":  these are LTS
with "normal" labelled transitions, as well as "special"  transitions,
whose labels are either of the form "<CODE>prob&nbsp;%p</CODE>" or "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;prob&nbsp;%p</CODE>", where <CODE>%p</CODE>
denotes a floating-point  number in the range ]0..1] and <I>label</I> denotes a character
string  that does not contain the "<CODE>;</CODE>" character. For each state, the sum
of  "<CODE>%p</CODE>" values on special transitions leaving the state must be less or
 equal than 1 (see ANNEX&nbsp;1 below for a discussion on how the probabilistic
LTS model of <B>bcg_min</B> generalizes other theoretical models published in
the literature), </LI><P><LI type=disc>or a "stochastic LTS":  these are LTS with "normal" labelled
transitions, as well as "special" transitions, whose labels are either
of the form "<CODE>rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>" or "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>", where <CODE>%f</CODE> denotes a strictly positive
floating-point number and <I>label</I> denotes a character string that does not
contain the "<CODE>;</CODE>" character (see ANNEX&nbsp;2 below for a discussion on how the
stochastic LTS model of <B>bcg_min</B> generalizes other theoretical models published
in the literature). </LI><P>

<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#sect3">General Options</A></H2>
The following <I>bcg_options</I> are currently
supported: <B>-version</B>, <B>-create</B>, <B>-update</B>, <B>-remove</B>, <B>-cc</B>, <B>-tmp</B>, <B>-uncompress</B>, <B>-compress</B>,
<B>-register</B>, <B>-short</B>, <B>-medium</B>, and <B>-size</B>. See the <A HREF="bcg.html"><B>bcg</B></A>
 manual page for a
description of these options. 
<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#sect4">Particular Options</A></H2>
The following options are
also supported: 
<DL><DD><DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>-strong&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> </DT>
<DD>Perform LTS reduction according to strong bisimulation.
On (Discrete or Continuous Time) Markov Chains and on Markov Reward Models,
this reduction  agrees with lumpability of [KS76] (see ANNEX&nbsp;1, ANNEX&nbsp;2,
and BIBLIOGRAPHY below). Default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-branching </B> </DT>
<DD>Perform LTS reduction
according to branching bisimulation. It is worth noticing that the notion
of branching bisimulation is rather meaningless for probabilistic systems.
Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-divbranching</B> </DT>
<DD>Perform LTS reduction according to divergence-sensitive
branching bisimulation [GW96]. Divergence-sensitive branching bisimulation
differs from branching bisimulation only in the way cycles of internal
transitions (also called divergences) are treated. It is known that all
states traversed by a cycle of internal transitions belong to the same
branching equivalence class. While divergences are eliminated in the LTS
obtained by reduction modulo ordinary branching bisimulation, a self-looping
internal transition is kept in each such equivalence class in the LTS obtained
by divergence-sensitive branching bisimulation. Unlike branching bisimulation,
divergence-sensitive branching bisimulation preserves inevitability properties.
Like branching bisimulation, it is worth noticing that the notion of divergence-sensitive
branching bisimulation is rather meaningless for probabilistic systems.
Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-observational</B> </DT>
<DD>Perform LTS reduction according to observational
equivalence [Mil89]. It is worth noticing that observational equivalence
is computationally more expensive than branching bisimulation, so that
reduction may fail even for graphs containing only few thousands of states.
To reduce the risk of failure, in a first step the input graph is automatically
reduced according to branching bisimulation. This is sound because branching
bisimulation is a graph relation stronger than observational equivalence.
However, this optimisation is not applied if the <B>-class</B> option is set, so
that <B>bcg_min</B> can print the equivalence classes relatively to the states
of the input graph, instead of the states of the branching minimal intermediate
graph produced in the first step. This option cannot be combined with neither
<B>-prob</B> nor <B>-rate</B> options. Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-normal </B> </DT>
<DD>Consider <I>input</I><B>.bcg</B> as
a normal LTS. With this option, labels of the form "<CODE>rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>" or "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>"
or "<CODE>prob&nbsp;%p</CODE>" or "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;prob&nbsp;%p</CODE>" are processed as  ordinary labels, without
special meaning attached. Default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-prob&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B> </DT>
<DD>Consider <I>input</I><B>.bcg</B> as a probabilistic
LTS. With this option, each  label of the form "<CODE>prob&nbsp;%p</CODE>" or "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;prob&nbsp;%p</CODE>"
is recognized as denoting a probabilistic transition with probability <CODE>%p</CODE>.
<B>bcg_min</B> will stop with an error message if, for some probabilistic  transition,
<CODE>%p</CODE> is out of ]0..1], or if the probabilistic transitions  going out of the
same state have a cumulated sum strictly greater than 1.  With this option,
labels of the form "<CODE>rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>" or "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>" are processed as ordinary
labels.  Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-rate&nbsp;[ -self ] </B> </DT>
<DD>Consider <I>input</I><B>.bcg</B> as a stochastic
LTS. With this option, each label of the form "<CODE>rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>" or "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>"
is recognized as denoting a stochastic transition with rate <CODE>%f</CODE>.  <B>bcg_min</B>
will stop with an error message if, for some stochastic  transition, <CODE>%f</CODE>
is less or equal to 0. If the <B>-branching</B> or the <B>-divbranching</B> option is selected,
and some state has both an  outgoing stochastic transition and an outgoing
internal (i.e., "tau")  transition, <B>bcg_min</B> will print a warning and remove
the stochastic  transition in order to preserve the notion of maximal progress.
With  this option, labels of the form "<CODE>prob&nbsp;%p</CODE>" or  "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;prob&nbsp;%p</CODE>" are processed
as ordinary labels.  Not a default option. <BR>
<BR>
If <B>-self</B> sub-option is given, all self loops (i.e., transitions that remain
within the same equivalence class) having labels of the form  "<CODE>rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>"
are removed. This implements the weak Markovian equivalences described in
[Bra02] and [BHKW05]. Not a default sub-option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-epsilon</B><I>&nbsp;eps</I> </DT>
<DD>Set the precision
of floating-point comparisons to <I>eps</I>, where <I>eps</I>  is a real value. When <I>eps</I>
is out of [0..1[, <B>bcg_min</B> reports an error. Default value for <I>eps</I> is 1E-6. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-format</B><I>&nbsp;format_string</I>
</DT>
<DD>Use <I>format_string</I> to control the format of the floating-point numbers contained
in transition labels (these numbers correspond to the occurrences of <CODE>%f</CODE>
and <CODE>%p</CODE> mentioned in section DESCRIPTION above). The value  of <I>format_string</I>
should obey the same conventions as the <I>format</I> parameter of function <B>sprintf</B>(3C)
for values of type <CODE>double</CODE>. Default value for <I>format_string</I> is <CODE>"%g"</CODE>, meaning
that floating-point numbers are printed with at most six digits after the
"." (i.e., the radix character). Other values can be  used, for instance <CODE>"%.9g"</CODE>
to obtain nine digits instead of six, or  by replacing the <CODE>"%g"</CODE> flag with
other flags, namely <CODE>"%e"</CODE>,  <CODE>"%E"</CODE>, <CODE>"%f"</CODE>, <CODE>"%G"</CODE>, possibly combined with additional
flags (e.g., to specify precision). </DD><P>

<DT><B>-class</B><I>&nbsp;class_file&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</I> </DT>
<DD>If <I>class_file</I> is the character
'-', then display the equivalence classes on the standard output. Otherwise,
display the equivalence classes in a file named <I>class_file</I>. Not a default
option. </DD><P>
</DL></DD><P></DL>
<P>
Note: In <B>bcg_min</B> versions up to 2.1, option <B>-class</B> was not followed
by a <I>class_file</I> argument and equivalence classes were always displayed
on the standard output. The <I>class_file</I> argument was introduced in <B>bcg_min</B>
version 2.2. Because such evolution breaks backward compatibility, <B>bcg_min</B>
issues an error message and stops if the argument following option <B>-class</B>
is either an option (i.e., starts with a hyphen) or a file name with extension
<B>.bcg</B>, which prevents overwriting an existing BCG file. <P>
Note: Options <B>-strong</B>,
<B>-branching</B>, and <B>-divbranching</B> are mutually exclusive. If they occur simultaneously
on the command-line, the option occurring  last is selected.  <P>
Note: Options
<B>-normal</B>, <B>-prob</B>, and <B>-rate</B> (with or without <B>-self</B> sub-option) are mutually exclusive.
If they occur simultaneously on the command-line, the option occurring last
is selected.   <BR>

Version
1.* of <B>bcg_min</B> was developed by Damien Bergamini (INRIA/VASY), Moez Cherif
(INRIA/VASY), Hubert Garavel (INRIA/VASY) and Holger Hermanns (University
of Twente). Pepijn Crouzen added -self sub-option. Version 1.* of <B>bcg_min</B> used
the following algorithms:  
<UL>
<LI type=disc>It used the algorithm of [KS90] to compute strong
bisimulation on a normal LTS. </LI><P><LI type=disc>It used the algorithm of [HS99] to compute
strong bisimulation on probabilistic and stochastic LTS. </LI><P><LI type=disc>It used the algorithm
of [GV90] to compute branching bisimulation on a normal LTS. The implementation
in <B>bcg_min</B> was derived from a Pascal program written by Jan Friso Groote
(CWI). </LI><P><LI type=disc>It used a variant of the algorithm of [HS99] to compute branching
bisimulation on a stochastic (resp. probabilistic) LTS: the branching bisimulation
condition was applied only to the "normal" fragment of the transition relation,
while the stochastic (resp. probabilistic) fragments were mimimized with
respect to strong bisimulation. </LI><P>
</UL>

Version 2.* of <B>bcg_min</B> was developed by Frederic
Lang (INRIA/VASY). It uses (sequential) variants of the signature-based algorithm
of [BO03] to compute strong, branching, and divergence-sensitive vranching
bisimulation on normal, probabilistic and stochastic LTS.
