exp, EXP - language for describing networks of communicating automata

<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#sect1">Description</A></H2>
This manual page presents EXP 2.0, which is a conservative extension
of a previous version EXP 1.0. EXP 2.0 allows networks of communicating automata
(also called <I>behaviours</I> in the sequel) to be modelled using operators of
several languages. <P>
In addition to LOTOS parallel composition and hiding
[ISO-89], already implemented in EXP 1.0, EXP 2.0 contains operators taken
from E-LOTOS [ISO-01] and LNT, CCS [Milner-89], CSP [Brookes-Hoare-Roscoe-84],
and mCRL [Groote-Ponse-90], as well as parallel composition using synchronisation
vectors, and generalized operators for label hiding, renaming, and cutting
(also called restriction in CCS or encapsulation in mCRL). EXP2.0 also contains
a priority operator that allows priorities between transitions to be defined.
<P>
Since these operators are taken from various languages that are not always
compatible (for instance, the hidden event is written "i" in LOTOS, E-LOTOS,
and LNT, "t" in CCS and CSP, "tau" in mCRL), <B>exp.open</B> allows the graph module
to be customized with respect to a particular language (called the <I>reference
language</I>). <P>
The customization operates on the following parameters: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>The string
representing hidden events. </LI><P><LI type=disc>The string representing the gate used to express
behaviour termination (e.g., "exit" in LOTOS, E-LOTOS, and LNT, "delta" in
CSP, irrelevant in CCS and mCRL). </LI><P><LI type=disc>Case sensitivity, i.e., whether labels in
the EXP file should be turned to upper-case or not. </LI><P><LI type=disc>The meaning of symbols
existing in different languages with different semantics ("\" in CCS and
CSP, "||" in LOTOS and mCRL). </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
See <A HREF="exp.open.html"><B>exp.open</B></A>
 for options enabling a definition
of these parameters. When these options are not used, default values are
associated to each of these parameters, depending on the reference language
selected. For backward compatibility reasons, there is no reference language
selected by default. See Section LANGUAGE PARAMETERS for details. <P>
Beware
that the <A HREF="aldebaran.html"><B>aldebaran</B></A>
 tool only works with EXP 1.0 descriptions and
that the <B>exp2fc2</B> tool is now deprecated. <P>
The publication [Lang-05] provides
an overview of <B>exp.open</B> 2.0 and its input language. 
<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#sect2">Syntax of EXP 2.0</A></H2>
<P>
The syntax
of EXP 2.0 is presented using a grammar in the Extended Backus-Naur Form
(EBNF): 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>Non-terminal symbols are written using capital letters (e.g., <I>B</I>). </LI><P><LI type=disc>Keywords
are written using lowercase characters (e.g., hide, par, in, etc.). </LI><P><LI type=disc>Key symbols
are written between double quotes to avoid ambiguities with EBNF symbols
(in particular, "|", "(", "[", "*", etc.). However, the quotes may be omitted
for non-ambiguous symbols (",", "&lt;-", etc.) </LI><P><LI type=disc>Definitions in natural language
are enclosed in angles (e.g., &lt;filename&gt;). </LI><P><LI type=disc>Optional sequences of symbols are
written between square brackets. </LI><P><LI type=disc>Star (*) denotes repetition zero or more
times of the preceding EBNF expression. </LI><P><LI type=disc>Plus (+) denotes repetition one
or more times of the preceding EBNF expression. </LI><P><LI type=disc>Operators * and + have precedence
over other EBNF operators. Parentheses are used to associate sequences of
symbols (e.g., "<I>G</I> (, <I>G</I>)*"). </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
The EXP 2.0 grammar is presented in several parts,
corresponding to the different languages supported.  We write "<I>B</I> ::= ... | <I>expression</I>"
to express that the definition of <I>B</I> is extended with <I>expression</I>.  The entry
point of the grammar is the non-terminal symbol <I>AXIOM</I>. <P>
The following productions
are common to all languages. <I>IDF</I> stands for any sequence of letters, digits,
and underscores ("_"), which begins with a letter and does not end with
an underscore. <I>LTS</I> stands for files containing an automaton, <I>FILE</I> for other
files, <I>G</I> for gates, <I>GL</I> for gate lists, <I>L</I> for labels, and <I>LL</I> for label lists.
<P>
Comments of the form <PRE>    (* &lt;any text on one or several lines&gt; *)
</PRE>and <PRE>    -- &lt;any text on one line&gt;
</PRE>are allowed in EXP 2.0 behaviours. <PRE>LTS ::= "&lt;filename&gt;"
     | IDF                 (* automaton without extension *)
     | "&lt;filename&gt;.bcg"
     | IDF.bcg             (* automaton in BCG format *)

      | IDF(.hid|.hide)    (* hide file *)
      | "&lt;filename&gt;(.ren|.rename)"
      | IDF(.ren|.rename)  (* rename file *)
      | "&lt;filename&gt;.cut"
      | IDF.cut            (* cut file *)
G ::= IDF                  (* gate *)
   |  "&lt;string denoting a gate&gt;"
GL ::= [G (, G)*]          (* gate list *)
L ::= G                    (* label *)
   |  "&lt;gate with offers&gt;"
   |  "&lt;regular expression denoting a gate&gt;"
   |  "&lt;regular expression denoting a gate with offers&gt;"
LL ::= [L (, L)*]          (* label list *)
</PRE><P>
Note that <I>L</I> can be a gate, or a gate followed by experiment offers, or
a regular expression denoting a gate possibly followed by experiment offers.
(See the definition of regular expressions in the <A HREF="regexp.html"><B>regexp</B></A>
 man page.)
The gate of a label <I>L</I> is the sub-string starting at the beginning of <I>L</I> and
ending at the first character !, ?, (, space, or tabulation, if any, or
at the end of <I>L</I> otherwise. <P>
For instance, "G", "G.*", "G !1", "G(1)", "G.*
!.*" are labels, among which "G" is a gate, "G.*" is a regular expression
denoting a gate or a gate with offers, "G !1" is a gate with offers, and
"G.* !.*" is a regular expression denoting a gate with offers (following
LOTOS syntax). Note that the syntax of offers is not restricted to LOTOS:
"G(1, 2)" also denotes a gate with offers. <P>
Double quotes around a label
can be omitted if and only if the label is a gate satisfying the syntax
of <I>IDF</I>, but they are mandatory to avoid syntactic ambiguities when a gate
has the same name as a reserved EXP keyword (e.g. "cut", "all", etc.) or when
a label contains special characters. <P>
Note: all escape character sequences
defined in the specification of ANSI C character constants, except octal
numbers, hexadecimal numbers, and '\n', are allowed in labels and filenames
enclosed in double quotes. These escape character sequences are replaced
by a single character accordingly. Every '\' character that does not belong
to an ANSI C escape character sequence is kept unchanged. For instance,
'\"' and '\\' are replaced respectively by '"' and '\', whereas '\p' and '\(' are kept unchanged.

<P>
EXP 2.0 satisfies the following precedence and associativity
rules: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>LOTOS "hide" gives precedence to infix parallel operators (same
as in LOTOS). For instance, the behaviour: <PRE>        hide G in "f1.bcg" ||| "f2.bcg"
</PRE>is parsed as: <PRE>        hide G in ("f1.bcg" ||| "f2.bcg")
</PRE></LI><P><LI type=disc>Infix parallel operators associate to the right. For instance, the behaviour:
<PRE>        "f1.bcg" ||| "f2.bcg" |[G]| "f3.bcg"
</PRE>is parsed as: <PRE>        "f1.bcg" ||| ("f2.bcg" |[G]| "f3.bcg")
</PRE></LI><P><LI type=disc>Postfix operators have precedence over all other operators. For instance,
the behaviour: <PRE>        "f1.bcg" | "f2.bcg" \ G
</PRE>is parsed as: <PRE>        "f1.bcg" | ("f2.bcg" \ G)
</PRE></LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
The syntax of EXP 2.0 is the union of all EBNF productions presented above,
with  the following exceptions:<BR>
 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>Inside "par" operators, behaviours using infix parallel operators are
enclosed in parenthesis or parenthesized operators (hide...end hide, rename...end
rename, etc.). For instance, the following behaviour is not syntactically
correct: <PRE>        par G in
           "f1.bcg" ||| "f2.bcg"
        || "f3.bcg"
        end par
</PRE>whereas the following behaviours are syntactically correct: <PRE>        par G in
           ("f1.bcg" ||| "f2.bcg")
        || "f3.bcg"
        end par
        par G in
           hide H in "f1.bcg" ||| "f2.bcg" end hide
        || "f3.bcg"
        end par
</PRE>Note in particular that the following two behaviours have different semantics:
<PRE>        par G in
           "f1.bcg"
        || "f2.bcg"
        || "f3.bcg"
        end par
and
        par G in
           ("f1.bcg" || "f2.bcg")
        || "f3.bcg"
        end par
</PRE>In the latter case, the "||" occurring in the parentheses corresponds to
the LOTOS or mCRL parallel composition operator, whereas all other occurrences
of "||" correspond to the E-LOTOS/LNT parallel symbol. </LI><P><LI type=disc>Similarly, the "hide"
operator must be ended by "end hide" (recommended) or enclosed in parentheses
when used inside parenthesized operators. </LI><P>

<H2><A NAME="sect10" HREF="#sect10">Semantics of EXP 2.0</A></H2>
<P>
This section
describes the semantics of all EXP 2.0 constructs. 
<H3><A NAME="sect11" HREF="#sect11">Labelled Transition Systems</A></H3>
<P>
<I>LTS</I>
may be the name of a file containing an automaton in one of the AUT (extension
<B>.aut</B>), BCG (extension <B>.bcg</B>), FC2 (extension <B>.fc2</B>), or SEQ (extension <B>.seq</B>)
file formats. <P>
All automaton files must have a known extension. However, the
extension may be omitted in the behaviour description if the automaton
is in the BCG or in the AUT format. If <I>LTS</I> has not a known extension, then
<B>exp.open</B> will first attempt to open <I>LTS</I><B>.bcg</B>. If <I>LTS</I><B>.bcg</B> does not exist in the
current directory, <B>exp.open</B> will then attempt to open <I>LTS</I><B>.aut</B>. <P>
Use of the
BCG format is recommended since <B>exp.open</B> will automatically convert other
formats to BCG using the <A HREF="bcg_io.html"><B>bcg_io</B></A>
 tool. 
<H3><A NAME="sect12" HREF="#sect12">EXP File Inclusion</A></H3>
<P>
<I>LTS</I> may also
be the name of an EXP file (extension <B>.exp</B>) within double quotes. In this
case, the contents of this EXP file is simply copied inside the current
EXP expression. This allows large expressions to be split into a hierarchy
of EXP files. <P>
Example: The expression <PRE>   "a.exp" || "b.bcg"
</PRE>where file "a.exp" contains the expression <PRE>   hide A in "a.bcg"
</PRE>is equivalent to <PRE>   hide A in "a.bcg" || "b.bcg"
</PRE>Note that this is parsed as <PRE>   hide A in ("a.bcg" || "b.bcg")
</PRE>hence parentheses may be required to avoid lexical scoping issues. 
<H3><A NAME="sect13" HREF="#sect13">Generalized
Hiding</A></H3>
<PRE>  [gate | total | partial] hide [all but] LL in B end hide
| [gate | total | partial] hide using FILE in B end hide
</PRE>will hide the labels found in <I>B</I> using the given hiding rules. These rules
can be specified either as a list of labels (first form), or using an external
file <I>FILE</I> (second form). <P>
In the first case, <B>exp.open</B> builds a temporary file,
filled with the given labels. In the second case, the hide file must be
provided by the user. No particular extension is required, but the filename
must be written between double quotes if it does not have the form <I>IDF</I>,
 <I>IDF</I><B>.hide</B>, or <I>IDF</I><B>.hid</B>. See the <A HREF="caesar_hide_1.html"><B>caesar_hide_1</B></A>
 man page for a definition
of the hide file format. <P>
The "all but" keywords modify the semantics of
the hiding rules: all the labels, except the labels specified in the list
of labels, are hidden. <P>
The keywords "total", "partial", and "gate" modify
the matching mode, that is the way the hiding rules are interpreted. See
the <A HREF="caesar_hide_1.html"><B>caesar_hide_1</B></A>
 man page. See also Section SYNTAX OF EXP 2.0 above,
which explains how the gate of a label is recognized. If no matching mode
is specified, then the default is "gate", which implements the LOTOS hiding
operator extended with regular expressions denoting gates. <P>
For every hiding
with "gate" matching, <B>exp.open</B> checks whether the gates to be hidden have
an appropriate syntax and issues a warning if they appear to contain experiment
offers (which is a common mistake for novice users). For instance, <PRE>        hide "G !1"
</PRE>will trigger a warning message because of the occurrence of "!1". <P>
<B>Examples</B>:
<PRE>        total hide "G"
</PRE>hides every label equal to "G", <PRE>        gate hide "G"
</PRE>hides every label whose gate is G, e.g., "G !1", "G !2", <PRE>        gate hide ".*G.*"
</PRE>hides every label whose gate contains the character G and <PRE>        partial hide "G"
</PRE>hides every label whose gate or offers contain the character G. <P>
See the
<A HREF="caesar_hide_1.html"><B>caesar_hide_1</B></A>
 man page for more information on matching mode semantics.
<A HREF="regexp.html"><B>regexp</B></A>
 man page for information about regular expression syntax.
<P>
The semantics of LOTOS "hide" is compatible with that of E-LOTOS/LNT, i.e.,
<PRE>        hide GL in B
</PRE>is equivalent to <PRE>        gate hide GL in B end hide
</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="sect14" HREF="#sect14">Generalized Renaming</A></H3>
<PRE>  [gate | total | single | multiple] rename
        L -&gt; L (, L -&gt; L)* in B end rename
| [gate | total | single | multiple] rename
        using FILE in B end rename
</PRE>will rename the labels of <I>B</I> using the given renaming rules. These rules
can be specified either as a list of items of the form <I>L</I> -&gt; <I>L</I> (first form),
or using an external file <I>FILE</I> (second form). <P>
In the first case <B>exp.open</B>
builds a temporary file, filled with the given substitution rules. In the
second case <B>exp.open</B> uses the given renaming file. No particular extension
is required, but the filename must be written between double quotes if
it does not have the form <I>IDF</I>,  <I>IDF</I><B>.rename</B>, or <I>IDF</I><B>.ren</B>. See the <A HREF="caesar_rename_1.html"><B>caesar_rename_1</B></A>

man page for a definition of the hide file format. <P>
See also Section SYNTAX
OF EXP 2.0 above, which explains how the gate of a label is recognized. The
keywords "total", "single", "multiple", and "gate" modify the way the left-hand
sides of the renaming rules are interpreted, see the <A HREF="caesar_rename_1.html"><B>caesar_rename_1</B></A>

man page. If no matching mode is specified, then the default is "gate". <P>
For
every renaming with "gate" matching, <B>exp.open</B> checks whether the gates to
be renamed have an appropriate syntax and issues a warning if they appear
to contain experiment offers (which is a common mistake for novice users).
For instance, <PRE>        rename "G !1" -&gt; "G !2"
</PRE>will trigger a warning message because of the occurrence of "!1" in the
left-hand side. Note however that <PRE>        rename "G" -&gt; "G !1"
</PRE>is correct. <P>
<B>Examples</B>: <PRE>        total rename "G" -&gt; "H"
</PRE>renames to "H" every label equal to "G", <PRE>        gate rename "G" -&gt; "H"
</PRE>renames to "H" every gate equal to "G", e.g., "G !1" is renamed to "H !1",
<PRE>        gate rename ".*G.*" -&gt; "H"
</PRE>renames to "H" every gate that contains a G character, <PRE>        single rename "G" -&gt; "H"
</PRE>replaces the first occurrence of "G" by "H" in every label whose gate or
offers contain a G character, <PRE>        multiple rename "G" -&gt; "H"
</PRE>replaces every occurrence of "G" by "H" in every label whose gate or offers
contain a G character, and <PRE>        total rename "\([a-zA-Z0-9]*\) \(!.*\)" -&gt; "\1 !1 \2"
</PRE>inserts "!1" between every gate (sequence of letters and digits) and its
offers (prefixed with !). <P>
See the <A HREF="caesar_rename_1.html"><B>caesar_rename_1</B></A>

<H3><A NAME="sect15" HREF="#sect15">Generalized Cut</A></H3>
<PRE>  [gate | total | partial] cut [all but] LL in B end cut
| [gate | total | partial] cut using FILE in B end cut
</PRE>is a generalization of mCRL encapsulation, on the same principles as the
generalized "hide" operator. Instead of being converted into silent transitions
as does the "hide" operator, transitions whose label matches the given
regular expressions are simply cut off. <P>
Cut files have the following syntax:
<PRE>AXIOM ::= &lt;blanks&gt; cut &lt;blanks&gt; \n LABELS
       |  &lt;blanks&gt; cut all but &lt;blanks&gt; \n LABELS
LABELS ::= (&lt;blanks&gt; L &lt;blanks&gt; \n)*
</PRE>where <I>L</I> is a label, and &lt;blanks&gt; is any sequence of spaces, tabulations,
carriage returns, newlines, vertical tabulation, or form feeds; these characters
are those recognized by the POSIX function isspace(); they are always skipped
and ignored. 
<H3><A NAME="sect16" HREF="#sect16">Generalized Priority</A></H3>
<PRE>  [gate | total | partial] prio
      ([all but] LL (&gt; [all but] LL)+)+
  in B end prio
</PRE>sets priorities between the transitions of <I>B</I>. In each state of <I>B</I>, a transition
may be executed only if all transitions of higher priority are not ready
for execution. <P>
Priorities between transitions (or equivalently, between
labels) are defined by a set of priority rules <I>X1</I> &gt; ... <I>Xn</I>, where each <I>Xi</I> has
the form [all but] <I>LLi</I> and <I>LL1</I>, ..., <I>LLn</I> are lists of regular expressions
denoting gates or labels. The "all but" keywords that may precede some <I>LLi</I>
means all gates or labels but those matching <I>LLi</I>. <P>
Such priority rules define
a transitive relation "&gt;&gt;" on labels as follows: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>if <I>X</I> &gt; <I>X'</I>, the visible label
<I>L</I> of <I>B</I> matches <I>X</I>, and the visible label <I>L'</I> of <I>B</I> matches <I>X'</I> then <I>L</I> &gt;&gt; <I>L'</I> </LI><P><LI type=disc>if <I>L</I>
&gt;&gt; <I>L'</I> and <I>L'</I> &gt;&gt; <I>L''</I> then <I>L</I> &gt;&gt; <I>L''</I> </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
<I>L</I> &gt;&gt; <I>L'</I> means that any transition labeled <I>L</I> has priority
over any transition labeled <I>L'</I> or, equivalently, any transition labeled
<I>L'</I> yields priority to any transition labeled <I>L</I>. <P>
The relation "&gt;&gt;" must be a
strict partial order: <I>B</I> must not contain any label <I>L</I> such that <I>L</I> &gt;&gt; <I>L</I>. If
"&gt;&gt;" is not a strict partial order, <B>exp.open</B> will issue an error message and

<PRE>  [gate | label] par [(all | S) in]
    [S -&gt;] B ("||" [S -&gt;] B)+ end par
</PRE>is an extension of the E-LOTOS/LNT generalized parallel composition operator
presented in [Garavel-Sighireanu-99]. It denotes the concurrent execution
of parallel behaviours following synchronisation rules expressed using:

<UL>
<LI type=disc>the keyword "all" or the list <I>S</I> that follows the keyword "par", called
<I>global synchronisation interface</I>, and </LI><P><LI type=disc>the lists <I>S</I> that precede the symbols
"-&gt;", called <I>local synchronisation interfaces</I>. </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
Synchronisation interfaces
<I>S</I> are lists of synchronisation elements of the form <I>L</I> or <I>L#N</I>, where <I>L</I> is
a gate or a label and <I>N</I> is a natural number called <I>synchronisation degree</I>.
<P>
The semantics of synchronisation rules is defined in the following paragraphs.
<P>
The "gate" or "label" keywords indicate the <I>synchronisation mode</I>, which
influences the way synchronisation rules apply to transition labels. We
say that a transition matches a synchronisation element of the form <I>L</I> or
<I>L#N</I> in the following cases: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>In "gate" synchronisation mode, a transition
matches <I>L</I> or <I>L#N</I> if the gate of the transition label is <I>L</I>. Therefore, for
every synchronisation element of the form <I>L</I> or <I>L#N</I> occurring in a synchronisation
interface, <I>L</I> must be a gate without offers. See Section SYNTAX OF EXP 2.0
above, which explains how the gate of a transition is extracted from its
label. </LI><P><LI type=disc>In "label" synchronisation mode, a transition matches <I>L</I> or <I>L#N</I> if
the transition label is <I>L</I>. Therefore, for every synchronisation element
of the form <I>L</I> or <I>L#N</I> occurring in a synchronisation interface, <I>L</I> must be
a full label (i.e., a gate possibly followed by offers). </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
Unlike "hide", "cut",
and "rename", regular expressions are not allowed in synchronisation elements.
If not specified, the synchronisation mode by default is "gate". <P>
The keyword
"all" is a shorthand notation for the global synchronisation set consisting
of all synchronisation elements <I>L</I> (without degree) such that <I>L</I> is the gate
(in "gate" synchronisation mode) or the label (in "label" synchronisation
mode) of a transition in at least one of the parallel behaviours, except
hidden and termination labels. <P>
Synchronisation elements have the following
meaning: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>A synchronisation element of the form <I>L</I> (without degree) occurring
in the global synchronisation interface indicates that all parallel behaviours
may synchronise all together on transitions that match <I>L</I>. </LI><P><LI type=disc>A synchronisation
element of the form <I>L</I> (without degree) occurring in a local synchronisation
interface indicates that all parallel behaviours that contain <I>L</I> in their
synchronisation interface may synchronise all together on transitions that
match <I>L</I>. </LI><P><LI type=disc>A synchronisation element of the form <I>L#N</I> occurring in the global
synchronisation interface indicates that <I>N</I> behaviours among the parallel
behaviours may synchronise together on transitions that match <I>L</I>. </LI><P><LI type=disc>A synchronisation
element of the form <I>L#N</I> occurring in a local synchronisation interface
indicates that <I>N</I> behaviours among the parallel behaviours that contain
<I>L#N</I> in their synchronisation interface may synchronise on transitions that
match <I>L</I>. </LI><P><LI type=disc>A transition in a parallel behaviour may execute asynchronously
if both the global synchronisation interface and the local synchronisation
interface of that behaviour do not contain any element of the form <I>L</I> or
<I>L#N</I> such that the transition matches <I>L<B>. </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
Note that both the global synchronisation
interface and local synchronisation interfaces may contain several synchronisation
elements with same label <I>L</I></B></I> but different synchronisation degrees. In this
case, the corresponding synchronisation rules apply nondeterministically.
<P>
Following the above meaning of synchronisation elements, it is possible
to prevent the execution of particular transitions matching <I>L</I> by using
synchronisation elements of the form <I>L#0</I>, either in the global synchronisation
interface (thus preventing execution of transitions matching <I>L</I> in all parallel
behaviours) or in local synchronisation interfaces (thus preventing execution
of transitions matching <I>L</I> in those behaviours containing <I>L#0</I> in their interface),
provided the (global or local) interface does not contain another occurrence
of <I>L</I> or <I>L#N</I> with <I>N</I> a strictly positive number. <P>
Transition synchronisation
is a generalization of LOTOS rendezvous: synchronisation requires that
all transitions have exactly the same label (i.e., gate and possible offers),
which is also the label of the resulting transition. <P>
Note that synchronisation
interfaces can neither contain the hidden gate nor the termination gate.
Behaviours always synchronise on labels whose gate is the termination gate
and never synchronise on hidden transitions. <P>

module, <B>exp.open</B> checks that generalized parallel operators are well-formed,
i.e.: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>If the global synchronisation interface contains a synchronisation

<H3><A NAME="sect18" HREF="#sect18">Parallel with Synchronisation Vectors</A></H3>
<PRE>  [gate | label] par using SV (, SV)* in B ("||" B)* end par
</PRE>is parallel composition with <I>synchronisation vectors</I>. It denotes the concurrent
execution of behaviours following synchronisation rules, expressed using
vectors of gates (in "gate" synchronisation mode) or labels (in "label"
synchronisation mode). <P>
A synchronisation vector <I>SV</I> has the form "<I>E1</I> || ... || <I>En</I>
-&gt; L", or equivalently "<I>E1</I> * ... * <I>En</I> -&gt; L", where each <I>Ei</I> (<I>i = 1..n</I>) is either
a visible gate without offers (in "gate" synchronisation mode), a visible
label, i.e., visible gate with offers (in "label" synchronisation mode),
or the special symbol "_" (in both synchronisation modes). Note that gates
and labels must not be defined using regular expressions. If it is not specified,
the synchronisation mode by default is "gate". See Section SYNTAX OF EXP
2.0 above, which explains how the gate of a label is recognized. <P>
The left-hand
side (left of the arrow) of each synchronisation vector must have as many
gates (or labels) and "_" symbols as there are behaviours <I>B</I> in parallel.
A gate (or label) <I>G</I> as nth component of a vector left-hand side means that
the nth behaviour in the parallel composition can perform a transition
whose gate is <I>G</I> only if all behaviours can perform simultaneously as specified
by the same vector, possibly on different gates, but with same offers (in
"gate" synchronisation mode). "_" means that no transition is required for
the corresponding behaviour. The resulting transition is labelled with the
right-hand side of the vector (in "label" synchronisation mode) or with
the right-hand side of the vector, followed by the offers, if any (in "gate"
synchronisation mode). The hidden string is forbidden in the left-hand side
of a synchronisation vector. <P>
Transitions that do not fit any vector are
blocked, except hidden transitions, which always perform asynchronously.
In particular, if one wants to let visible transitions perform asynchronously,
it is necessary to define vectors whose left-hand side contain only "_"
but one visible gate. <P>

Transitions of both behaviours

Synchronisation is possible only if the corresponding transition
labels are <I>co-actions</I>, i.e., they have the same gate and offers, but one of
the gates is prefixed with the co-action prefix. The co-action prefix by default
is "'" but can be modified using the <B>-coaction</B> option of <A HREF="exp.open.html"><B>exp.open</B></A>
. Note
that (1) the co-action prefix should not contain !, ?, (, space, and tabulation
characters, which are used to delimit a gate from its offer, and (2) there
should not be any space or tabulation between the co-action prefix and the
gate identifier (see Section SYNTAX OF EXP 2.0 above, which explains how
the gate of a label is recognized). <P>
For instance, transitions labelled "G"
and "'G" may synchronise, as well as transitions labelled "G O" and "'G O".
In both cases, the resulting label after synchronisation is the hidden

In "<I>B1</I> || <I>B2</I>", transitions may either

A communication rule has the form "<I>G1</I> | <I>G2</I> = <I>G3</I>", where <I>G1</I>, <I>G2</I>, and <I>G3</I> are
gates. Communication rules are commutative, i.e., there is no difference between
"<I>G1</I> | <I>G2</I> = <I>G3</I>" and "<I>G2</I> | <I>G1</I> = <I>G3</I>". Such a rule means that if an operand (<I>B1</I>
or <I>B2</I>) may perform a transition whose gate is <I>G1</I> and the other operand
may perform a transition whose gate is <I>G2</I>, and both transitions carry the
same experiment offers <I>O</I>, then a synchronisation is possible and results
in a transition labelled "<I>G3 O</I>". See Section SYNTAX OF EXP 2.0 above, which
explains how the gate of a label is recognized. <P>
Note that hidden transitions
must perform asynchronously, and that there must be at most one communication
rule for each pair of gates occurring in the left-hand side of the "=" symbol.
For instance, the following is not allowed: <PRE>comm G1 | G2 = G3, G2 | G1 = G4 end comm

Note that the reference language must be mCRL in order for the "||" operator
to have mCRL semantics instead of LOTOS semantics.  If the reference language

the default parameter values according to reference languages. Note that
these values (in particular lines labelled none and LOTOS) are compatible
with <B>exp.open</B> version 1.0.  <PRE>+----------+--------+--------+-------------+------+-------+
| language | hidden | termin.|    case     | sem. | sem.  |
|          | event  |  gate  | sensitivity | of \ | of || |

</PRE>where N/A stands for <I>Not Applicable</I>. <P>
* The parameters associated to E-LOTOS
are subject to modifications in the future, depending on implementation
choices still to be made. <P>
Note that the hidden string (written either "i",
"t", "tau", or anything else) should not be followed by communication offers,
whereas the termination string may. 
<H2><A NAME="sect28" HREF="#sect28">How to Create an EXP File</A></H2>
<P>
At present,
EXP files can be either written by hand or produced automatically by <A HREF="svl.html"><B>svl</B></A>

from SVL scripts containing some parallel composition operator. 
<H2><A NAME="sect29" HREF="#sect29">How to Read
an EXP File</A></H2>
At present, there is one single CADP tool, <A HREF="exp.open.html"><B>exp.open</B></A>
