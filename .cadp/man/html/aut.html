aut, AUT - simple file format for labelled transition systems 
<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#sect1">Description</A></H2>
The
AUT format (where <I>AUT</I> stands for <I>AUTomaton</I>), also called the ALDEBARAN
format, is a simple file format for representing labelled transition systems.
<P>
The AUT format has been present in the CADP toolbox since its origins (see
the HISTORY section below for details about the chronology of the AUT format).
<P>
Because of its simplicity and because it is human readable, this format
has enjoyed some popularity in academia among developers of verification
and  testing tools. <P>
However, the AUT format suffers from three drawbacks:
 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>Because it is a text format, it is not compact enough to efficiently store
very large transitions systems (both in terms of disk space and access
time). </LI><P><LI type=disc>Because the AUT format definition was kept as simple as possible,
the various  implementations would often diverge, for instance, regarding
the maximal length for label strings, the places where white spaces are
allowed, etc. </LI><P><LI type=disc>There was a lot of redundant work across these implementations,
as each  developer would have to implement the same functionalities, e.g.,
to store labels and transitions in main memory. </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
To address these issues
(and others), the CADP toolbox has been, since 1993, equipped with an alternative
file format named BCG (see the <A HREF="bcg.html"><B>bcg</B></A>
 manual page for details). Progressively,
the BCG format has supplanted the AUT format in CADP, and most of the CADP
tools nowadays that can read or write the AUT format do it by internal
translation from/to BCG.  <P>
Thus, it is advised to use the BCG format rather
than the AUT format when  developing new tools. The only exception to this
general principle concerns those tools developed using a programming language
that can not bridge with the BCG code libraries provided by the CADP toolbox.

<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#sect2">Specification of the AUT Format (2014 Version)</A></H2>
Labelled transition systems
encoded in the AUT format are stored in files  having the <B>.aut</B> suffix.  <P>
In
an AUT file, each state is represented by a natural (i.e., unsigned) number.
<P>
Blanks (i.e., white spaces, tabulations, etc.) may appear everywhere between
lexical tokens (i.e., keywords, numbers, strings, commas, parentheses, etc.),
and also at the beginning or end of each line. Blanks are not significant
and can be discarded, except inside quoted labels. <P>
Line breaks are significant.
Each line should be terminated with a line-feed (LF) character, with the
possible exception of the last line of the file. To ensure compatibility
with Windows, each line-feed character may be  preceded (or not) by a carriage-return
(CR) character. <P>
The numbers of states and transitions should be at least
32-bit wide, which  enables 4 billions of states and transitions. On 64-bit
machines, wider numbers can be used, but the size of AUT files is likely
to become prohibitive for  large models (in such case, the BCG format is
the option of choice). <P>
In the AUT format, only 7-bit ASCII characters are
accepted. This is  currently found to be sufficient for the study of concurrent
systems. <P>
The first line of an AUT file has the following syntax: <PRE>   des (&lt;initial-state&gt;, &lt;number-of-transitions&gt;, &lt;number-of-states&gt;)
</PRE>The "<CODE>des</CODE>" keywords stands for "descriptor".  The <CODE>&lt;number-of-states&gt;</CODE> must be
greater or equal to 1, because there is always at least one state, the
initial state. State numbers range between 0 and <CODE>&lt;number-of-states&gt; - 1</CODE>. The <CODE>&lt;initial-state&gt;</CODE>
is always equal to 0. <P>
The remainder of the AUT file consists of one line
per transition, in an arbitrary order. Each remaining line has the following
syntax: <PRE>   (&lt;from-state&gt;, &lt;label&gt;, &lt;to-state&gt;)
</PRE>where <CODE>&lt;from-state&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;to-state&gt;</CODE> are state numbers, and where &lt;label&gt; can take
two possible forms: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc><CODE>&lt;unquoted-label&gt;</CODE> consists of a character string starting
with a letter, and followed by zero, one, or many letters, digits, or underscore
characters. To ensure backward compatibility with the version of AUT format
used by the <A HREF="tgv.html"><B>tgv</B></A>
 tool, the character string consisting of a single
'<CODE>*</CODE>' character is also accepted as a valid unquoted label. </LI><P><LI type=disc><CODE>&lt;quoted-label&gt;</CODE> consists
of a character string starting with a double quote and ending with a double
quote. Between these two double quotes, there can be zero, one or many printable
characters; the meaning of "printable" is given by the POSIX isprint()
function with locale "C" (namely, ASCII characters with decimal codes in
the range from 32 to 126, bounds included). No other assumption should be
made about the characters present between  these two double quotes. In particular,
the double quote character itself may be present, and may not necessarily
be "escaped" in some way (e.g., preceded by a backslash, as in C). </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
Any conformant
implementation of the AUT format should at least handle labels that are
5000-character long; handling labels of unbounded length is obviously better.
<P>
An unquoted label (e.g., <CODE>PUT_1</CODE>) can also be written as a quoted label (e.g.,
<CODE>"PUT_1"</CODE>) without changing its meaning: both labels should be considered
to be identical. This rule also applies to the '<CODE>*</CODE>' label. <P>
The non-observable
label (also called invisible label, or hidden label, and usually noted
"tau" in concurrency theory) is noted <CODE>i</CODE> in the AUT format, following a
convention set by the ISO International Standard 8807 "LOTOS". This same
label can also be noted <CODE>"i"</CODE>, but the unquoted notation is better for compactness.
Notice that there is no way to express an observable label that would be
noted <CODE>i</CODE>; this is not a problem for languages such as LOTOS and LNT, in
which <CODE>i</CODE> is a reserved keyword or a reserved gate identifier. <P>
By default,
labels are case sensitive, meaning that two labels such as  <CODE>"put"</CODE> and <CODE>"PUT"</CODE>
should be considered to be different.  <P>
If each label can semantically be
seen as a tuple consisting of a communication port (or gate, channel, etc.)
followed by zero, one, or many typed values, then it is recommended (although
not mandatory) to write labels according to the syntax conventions defined
in the LABEL PARSING section of the <A HREF="bcg_write.html"><B>bcg_write</B></A>
 manual page, and to
enable label parsing when processing the AUT file using the CADP tools.
<P>
When label parsing is enabled, two labels may be considered to be the same
even if they are not character-wise identical. For instance, label  <CODE>"PUT!false!'\x23'"</CODE>
will be turned into <CODE>"PUT !FALSE !'#'"</CODE> by label parsing, and both labels will
be considered to be the same. 
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#sect3">Example of an AUT File</A></H2>
This is an example of
a valid AUT file: <PRE>   des (0, 5, 4)
   (0, PUT_6, 1)
   (0, "GET !true !7 !CONS (A, CONS (B, NIL))", 2)
   (1, i, 3)
   (2, "SEND !"hello" !"world"", 3)
   (3, "DUMP ... " ... \" ...", 0)
</PRE>The two latter transitions illustrate that no particular assumption should
be  made about occurrences of double quotes in labels: neither must they
be  systematically preceded by a backslash, nor must they occur an even
number of times, etc. 
<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#sect4">How to Create an AUT File</A></H2>
At present, there are two
CADP tools that directly create AUT files: <A HREF="caesar.html"><B>caesar</B></A>
 when invoked with
its <CODE>-aldebaran</CODE> option, and <A HREF="bcg_io.html"><B>bcg_io</B></A>
. <P>
The easiest way to produce an AUT
file is to first create a BCG file using the <A HREF="bcg_write.html"><B>bcg_write</B></A>
 application
programming interface, and then invoke the <A HREF="bcg_io.html"><B>bcg_io</B></A>
 tool to convert
this BCG file into an AUT file. <P>
Otherwise, it is easy to produce AUT files
directly by writing lines to a file. The only issue may be to produce the
descriptor line if the total numbers of  states and/or transitions are
not already known at the moment the AUT file is created. To solve this issue,
<A HREF="caesar.html"><B>caesar</B></A>
 writes a first line of the following form: <PRE>   des (0, ?, ?)_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
</PRE>where the _'s denote a sufficient number of white spaces, and then proceeds
 normally writing the subsequent lines corresponding to the transitions.
When all transitions have been written, the numbers of states and transitions
should be known. One can then skip back to the beginning of the file, e.g.,
using the ftell() POSIX primitive, and overwrite the first line with the
actual numbers. <P>
When an AUT file is generated directly, its correctness
can be checked by  converting it to a BCG file, then back to an AUT file
using the <A HREF="bcg_io.html"><B>bcg_io</B></A>
 tool. If the former AUT file is correct, the conversion
should succeed. If  label parsing is disabled during the conversion, both
AUT files should be  character-wise identical (with the possible exception
of blanks that might have been inserted  or removed outside labels). If
label parsing is enabled, the conversion will additionally parse the contents
of each label, check its correctness, and possibly turn some values into
their normal form.  
<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#sect5">How to Read an AUT File</A></H2>
At present, there is one single
CADP tool, <A HREF="bcg_io.html"><B>bcg_io</B></A>
, that directly reads AUT files. This is a design
decision to stop maintaining multiple parsers. <A HREF="bcg_io.html"><B>bcg_io</B></A>
 is the reference
parser for the AUT format. It has command-line options to enable or disable
label parsing. <P>
The easiest way to read an AUT file is to first convert it
to BCG using the <A HREF="bcg_io.html"><B>bcg_io</B></A>
 tool, and then opening the resulting BCG
file using the <A HREF="bcg_read.html"><B>bcg_read</B></A>
 application programming interface, which
provides primitives and data structures for loading and accessing the labelled
transition system in memory. <P>
Otherwise, it is always possible to write a
new parser for the AUT format. The simplest approach is to write it manually.
There is yet an involved point: when reading an AUT file, quoted labels
should not be parsed from left to right, as it is not possible, upon occurrence
of a double quote character, to immediately decide whether this character
marks the end of the label, or if it is just a double quote present in
the middle of the label (technically, this is a shift-reduce conflict in
the grammar).  <P>
The recommended way of parsing quoted labels is to read the
entire transition line in a buffer and search for the leftmost and rightmost
double quotes, e.g., using the POSIX functions strchr() and strrchr(). The
quoted label is the  sub-string of characters located between these two
double quotes. <P>
As an alternative to manual writing, a parser generator may
be used, but one should keep in mind that the AUT format cannot be simply
parsed from left to right because double quotes are allowed inside labels.
Using a parser generator will only work if the generated parser can perform
lookahead and take decisions based upon the right-hand context to resolve
shift-reduce conflicts. If so, the double quote that terminates a label can
be characterized as any double quote that is followed by no other double
quote before the end of line. 
<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#sect6">History of the AUT Format</A></H2>
An early version
of the AUT format was defined in 1987, as part of the  VENUS tool [Sor87]
for the verification of communicating systems. Because this tool was written
in Prolog, the file format for describing automata  was naturally a set
of Prolog clauses. For instance, the transition relation of a given automaton
<I>A</I> was described as a set of clauses of the form: <I>A</I> (<I>state1</I>, <I>label</I>, <I>state2</I>).
<P>
The actual AUT format was defined in 1988, as part of the ALDEBARAN tool
[Fer88] for the verification of communicating processes. The Prolog-clause
style of the VENUS format was kept (for instance, on the first line), sometimes
with simplifications (for instance, the automaton name <I>A</I> was dropped from
each transition clause). <P>
In 1989, Hubert Garavel extended the syntax with
labels between double quotes, so as to provide support for the labelled
transition systems generated from  value-passing LOTOS specifications. <P>
The
AUT format remained unchanged until September 2014, when Hubert Garavel
introduced the explicit possibility of having double quotes in labels,
so as to support concurrent modelling languages with rich data types, in
particular the LNT and PseuCo languages that can pass character string
values across communication channels. The specification of the AUT format
was revised and made more precise.
