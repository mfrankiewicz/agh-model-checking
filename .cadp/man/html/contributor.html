This
program is a utility that you can use to contribute to CADP testing, by
sending files to be added to the regression test suite. You can use it to
select files on your computer and to send them by FTP transfer to the CADP
development team. Your files will help our continuing efforts to improve
quality and stability of CADP, and your contribution ensures that we will
 test features that are of particular interest to you. <P>
The files that you
contribute are related to CADP, such as LOTOS  specifications, BCG graphs,
MCL or XTL formulas, Boolean equation systems, etc. They are treated as
confidential and used only by the CADP team for testing future versions
of CADP. <P>
<B>contributor</B> runs on your local machine, making no network connection
except to send  your contribution to the CADP team by FTP at the end of
processing. <P>
You have complete control over when you use <B>contributor</B>. You
choose the directories that <B>contributor</B> is allowed to search, and the types
of files (by specifying the file  extensions) that <B>contributor</B> is allowed
to consider.  To refine this set of directories and files, <B>contributor </B>
has also built-in rules that attempt to select only those files that are
 relevant for testing CADP tools.  <P>
Additionally, you have an opportunity
to review the set of selected files and to exclude any that you do not
wish to send. <P>
<B>contributor </B> does not send files you have previously contributed
(to avoid duplicates)  nor files that you have already excluded during
a previous invocation of <B>contributor</B>. <P>
Running  <B>contributor </B> only takes a
few minutes, and it has no impact on other CADP components.  You are recommended
to run it every six months and on completion of significant work, which
will help the CADP team to keep the regression test suite up to date and
in line with the needs of CADP users. Use of  <B>contributor </B> is completely
optional, but is greatly appreciated. 
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#sect3">Preferences and Rules</A></H2>
Each time you
use  <B>contributor, </B> it saves (in a directory named <CODE>~/.config/cadp/contributor</CODE>)
information about the preferences you specified for <B>contributor</B>, such as
the list of directories to search, the file extensions to consider, the
files you specifically excluded, the files already sent, etc. This information
is used the next time you use <B>contributor</B>, but you can override it. <P>
<B>contributor
</B> has a built-in set of rules that exclude files that seem unrelated to CADP.
These rules are defined for each file extension. For example, a C program
 (with a "<CODE>.c</CODE>" or "<CODE>.h</CODE>" file extension) will only be selected if it contains
certain strings (e.g., the string "<CODE>CAESAR</CODE>"). There are also limits on the
size of files that can be selected. User selection has precedence over the
built-in rules, so you can decide to send any file, even if the rules would
otherwise exclude it from the contribution.  
<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#sect4">Usage</A></H2>
There are five steps to
using <B>contributor</B>: <P>
<B>1.</B> Select the directories where the files to send are
located. If you are using  <B>contributor </B> for the first time, your home directory
is included by default.  <CENTER><P><IMG SRC="pictures/contrib1.gif"></P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>2.</B> Select the file types (file extensions) of the files to be sent. <CENTER><P><IMG SRC="pictures/contrib2.gif"></P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>3.</B> Based on your selection <B>contributor </B> computes a proposed list of files
to be sent, by applying your preferences and the built-in rules, not selecting
files that have already been sent or files that you previously excluded.
<CENTER><P><IMG SRC="pictures/contrib3.gif"></P>
</CENTER> <P>
<B>4.</B> Review the proposed list,
and add or exclude files to get the final list you want to send to the
CADP team. You can view the content of a file by double-clicking on its name.
Also, by checking the relevant boxes on the the right of the window, you
can view the files that are excluded by  your preferences (user-excluded
files), the files that are excluded by the  built-in rules (rules-excluded
files), and the files that have already been sent. <CENTER><P><IMG SRC="pictures/contrib4.gif"></P>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>5.</B> Using your final selection list,  <B>contributor </B> creates a <CODE>.tar.gz</CODE> archive
containing all the files selected, and sends it by FTP to <A HREF="ftp.inrialpes.fr."><CODE>ftp.inrialpes.fr</CODE>.</A>

 <CENTER><P><IMG SRC="pictures/contrib5.gif"></P>
</CENTER> <P>
Note: This archive is
stored in the directory specified by the <CODE>$CADP_TMP</CODE> environment variable,
or in <CODE>/tmp</CODE> if this variable is undefined.  If the FTP transfer via <B>contributor</B>
fails, retry the FTP transfer manually. If this is still unsuccessful, please
contact the CADP team to arrange another method of transfering the file.
