gcf, GCF - Grid Configuration File format 
<H2><A NAME="sect1" HREF="#sect1">Description</A></H2>
<P>
A file in the
GCF (Grid Configuration File) format has a <B>.gcf</B> extension and specifies
a list of "instances" (i.e., distributed processes) to be launched by the
CADP tools providing distributed verification, such as <A HREF="distributor.html"><B>distributor</B></A>
,
<A HREF="bcg_merge.html"><B>bcg_merge</B></A>
, and the PBG tools as well: <A HREF="pbg_cp.html"><B>pbg_cp</B></A>
, <A HREF="pbg_info.html"><B>pbg_info</B></A>
,
etc. Such a tool will be called the "parent program" in the sequel. The GCF
format also specifies the various variables used for launching,  connecting
and parameterizing instances on remote machines. <P>
Each instance corresponds
to a pair (<I>machine</I>, <I>directory</I>). For each instance, a distributed process
executing on <I>machine</I> will be launched by the parent program. This distributed
process will store its  files in <I>directory</I> located on some filesystem of
<I>machine</I>.  <I>directory</I> is called the "working directory" of the instance. <P>
Instances
may or may not be launched on the local machine, depending on the constraints
on grid usage. For instance, clusters often distinguish between one frontal
node (i.e., the local machine) used to submit jobs to the cluster, and many
computing nodes (i.e., the remote machines) that perform distributed computations.
<P>
Each instance is given a unique number greater or equal to 1. Numbers are
assigned in the same order as instances appear in the grid configuration
file. Number 0 is reserved for the process corresponding to the execution
of the parent program on the local machine. <P>
If the grid configuration file
contains duplicated instances (i.e., same machine and same directory), only
the last one is considered, the previous ones being entirely discarded.
<P>
There should be at least two different instances. Several instances may
execute on the same machine, provided that their working directories are
different. Also, a working directory may be either local to its machine
or shared between several machines (using NFS, Samba, etc.). <P>
The grid configuration
file also specifies the value of (predefined) variables used to control
the way instances are launched and communicate with each other. 
<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#sect2">Syntax of
the GCF Format</A></H2>
<P>
The grid configuration file has the following syntax: <PRE>   &lt;gcf&gt;          ::= &lt;global_opt&gt; &lt;instance_opt&gt;*
   &lt;global_opt&gt;   ::= &lt;directive&gt;*
   &lt;instance_opt&gt; ::= &lt;machine&gt; &lt;machine&gt;* &lt;directive&gt;*
   &lt;machine&gt;      ::= &lt;address-or-name&gt; "\n"
   &lt;directive&gt;    ::= &lt;variable&gt; "=" &lt;value&gt; "\n"
   &lt;variable&gt;     ::= "buffer_size" | "cadp" | "connect_timeout"
                   |  "directory" | "files" | "hash" | "memory"
                   |  "port" |  "rcp" | "rsh" | "time" | "user"
   &lt;value&gt;        ::= &lt;character-string&gt;
</PRE><P>
where: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc><CODE>&lt;global_opt&gt;</CODE> is a (possibly empty) list of directives applicable to
every instance.  </LI><P><LI type=disc><CODE>&lt;instance_opt&gt;</CODE> defines one or several instances together
with a  (possibly empty) list of directives applicable to these instances
exclusively. </LI><P><LI type=disc><CODE>&lt;machine&gt;</CODE> is the name of a (local or remote) machine, either
given as  a numerical IP address (e.g., "138.96.146.2") or as an Internet machine
name (e.g., "vasy.inria.fr"), followed by a newline character. </LI><P><LI type=disc><CODE>&lt;directive&gt;</CODE> is
an assignment of a <CODE>&lt;value&gt;</CODE> to a <CODE>&lt;variable&gt;</CODE>, followed by a newline character.
 </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
Any line starting with the "#" character is considered as a comment and
ignored. Spaces and tabulations can be inserted before, between, or after
terminal symbols. 
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#sect3">GCF Variables</A></H2>
<P>
Variables can be modified by directives as
follows. First, some variables have a default value, which will be used
unless overriden by some directive. A <CODE>&lt;directive&gt;</CODE> occurring in the <CODE>&lt;global_opt&gt;</CODE>
list assigns its  <CODE>&lt;variable&gt;</CODE> for all machines. A directive occurring in a
<CODE>&lt;instance_opt&gt;</CODE> list assigns its <CODE>&lt;variable&gt;</CODE> only for the machines mentioned
in this <CODE>&lt;instance_opt&gt;</CODE>, possibly overriding the value  specified for this
<CODE>&lt;variable&gt;</CODE> in the <CODE>&lt;global_opt&gt;</CODE> list. <P>
The meaning of the different variables
is the following: 
<DL><DD><DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>buffer_size</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable specifies the size (in bytes)
of the communication buffers used between instances (either for incoming
data or outgoing data). This variable can only be set in the <CODE>&lt;global_opt&gt;</CODE>
list, meaning that all communication buffers must have the same size. Maximal
value is 2,147,483,648. Default value is 65536. </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>cadp</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable specifies
the pathname of the directory in which the CADP  toolbox is installed. This
pathname must be an absolute one, i.e., it must start with a "/" character.
It may contain spaces provided that the entire pathname is enclosed between
double quotes.  <P>
The pathname may be the same for all machines (e.g., if the
CADP toolbox  is installed on a common filesystem shared between all machines)
or may be different on each machine. In any case, the CADP toolbox should
be properly installed on the local and remote machines. Default value is
given by the <CODE>$CADP</CODE> environment variable.  </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>connect_timeout</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable
specifies the timeout (in seconds) allowed for establishing a connection
to a remote machine. This variable can only be set in the  <CODE>&lt;global_opt&gt;</CODE> list,
meaning that each connection must succeed within the specified timeout.
Default value is 20 seconds. </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>directory</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable specifies the pathname
of the working directory in which an instance will place all the files
needed for its execution or created during its execution (e.g., a copy of
the binary code of the parent program, a  copy of the GCF file, a generated
BCG file fragment, log files, etc.). If the specified directory does not
exist, it will be created. <P>
This pathname can be either an absolute one (starting
with a "/" character) or a relative one, in which case it is interpreted
with respect to the current directory on the local machine and to the user's
home directory on remote machines. It may contain spaces provided that the
entire pathname  is enclosed between double quotes. It should not contain
the tilde character "~".   Default value is the user's home directory (which
is not recommended unless when using a cluster of machines). </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>files</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This
variable specifies a set of files to be copied to the remote machines (in
the working directory) before launching the different instances. Setting
this variable provides to instances executing on remote machines additional
input files needed for their execution. This allows to take into account
 "hidden" dependences, as these input files may or may not be mentioned
on the command line used to invoke the parent program. <P>
For instance, when
running the parent program <A HREF="distributor.html"><B>distributor</B></A>
 using <A HREF="bcg_open.html"><B>bcg_open</B></A>
, the
<I>spec</I><B>.bcg</B> file must be present on the remote machines. Similarly, when running
<A HREF="distributor.html"><B>distributor</B></A>
 using <A HREF="exp.open.html"><B>exp.open</B></A>
, all the BCG files referenced in
<I>spec</I><B>.exp</B> must also be present on the remote machines. <P>
This variable may specify
either a single filename or a set of filenames separated by spaces. Filenames
may contain the wildcard characters ("*", "?", "[", "]", ...) according to
the Bourne shell conventions. Default value is empty. </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>hash</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable
specifies the hash function to be used for partitioning states between
machines (see [GMS01] for details). Its value is an integer <I>n</I> between 0
and 7 denoting the corresponding function <CODE>CAESAR_STATE_</CODE><I>n</I><CODE>_HASH()</CODE> of the
 <A HREF="caesar_hash.html"><B>caesar_hash</B></A>
 library of OPEN/CAESAR. This variable can only be set
in the  <CODE>&lt;global_opt&gt;</CODE> list, meaning that all instances use the same hash function.
Default value is 3. </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>memory</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable has currently no effect. It is reserved
for future use. </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>port</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable specifies the TCP port to be used for
communicating with the instance. Usually, it is not necessary to set this
variable explicitly unless to comply with firewall restrictions. A TCP port
is an integer value  in the range 1...65,535. Using a TCP port lower than 1024
is not recommended and may require special privileges (such as being the
super-user on Unix systems).  By default, or in case of failure when opening
the specified port, the port value is chosen automatically. </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>rcp</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable
specifies the command used to copy files from the local machine to the
working directories on the remote machines. This command must be present
in one of the directories given by the  <CODE>$PATH</CODE> environment variable. Its
command line syntax should be the same as for the <B>rcp</B>(1) command, i.e., <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>rcp</B> <I>local_files</I> <I>username</I>@<I>hostname</I>:<I>directory</I> <P>
Default value is <CODE>rcp</CODE>. Other
possible values are <CODE>scp</CODE>, <CODE>kcp</CODE>, or any similar variant of <B>rcp</B>(1). Remote machines
should be configured in such a way that remote copy can be done automatically
without asking for a password or a passphrase;  this is usually done by
setting an appropriate ".rhosts" or ".ssh/authorized_keys" file and/or launching
an SSH agent before running the parent program. <P>
There is also a special
value <CODE>nfs</CODE>, which indicates that all instances have the same working directory
on a filesystem shared between all machines (e.g., using NFS), so that no
remote copy is necessary. Setting variable <CODE>rcp</CODE> to the value <CODE>nfs</CODE> can only
be done in the <CODE>&lt;global_opt&gt;</CODE> list.  </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>rsh</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable specifies the command
used to lauch instances on remote machines from the local machine. This
command must be present in one of the directories given by the <CODE>$PATH</CODE> environment
variable. Its command line syntax should be the same as for the <B>rsh</B>(1) command,
i.e., <BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>rsh -l</B> <I>username</I> <I>hostname</I> "<I>shell_command ...</I>" <P>
Default value is <CODE>rsh</CODE>. Other possible
values are <CODE>ssh</CODE>, <CODE>krsh</CODE>, or any similar variant of <B>rsh</B>(1). Remote machines
should be configured in such a way that remote authentication can be done
automatically without asking for a password or a passphrase; this is usually
done by setting an appropriate ".rhosts" or ".ssh/authorized_keys" file and/or
launching an SSH agent before running the parent program. <P>
It is possible
to supply options to the command assigned to the <I>rsh</I> variable (such as
<CODE>rsh=ssh -6</CODE>) but certain options (e.g., <CODE>ssh -v</CODE>) program. </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>time</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable,
if set, contains a Unix command name that will be inserted before the shell
commands used to launch instances on remote machines. Possible values of
this variable are "/usr/bin/time", "memtime", "valgrind", etc. It is therefore
possible to monitor the time, memory, etc. used by remote instances on these
machines. Default value is the empty string. <P>
Alternatively, one can obtain
the same effect by setting the (undocumented) <CODE>$CADP_TIME</CODE> environment variable;
this is equivalent to setting in the ".gcf" file the "time" variable for
all remote instances. </DD><P>

<DT><CODE>user</CODE>:</DT>
<DD>This variable specifies the user login name (or
account name) to be used for authentication when connecting to the remote
machine(s). Default value is the name of the user running the parent program
on the local machine. </DD><P>
</DL></DD><P></DL>

<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#sect4">Examples of GCF Files</A></H2>
<P>
In its simplest form, a grid
configuration file may simply list the remote machines to be used: <PRE>   machine1
   machine2
   machine3
   machine4
</PRE><P>
It is also possible to write a grid configuration file with several instances
on the same machine: <PRE>   machine1
      directory=/tmp/instance1
   machine1
      directory=/tmp/instance2
   machine1
      directory=/tmp/instance3
</PRE><P>
This is a more complex example involving all the features described above:
<PRE>   buffer_size = 32768
   cadp = /usr/local/cadp
   connect_timeout = 10
   directory = /home/vasy/distributor
   files = graph-*.bcg
   hash = 4
   port = 8016
   rcp = scp
   rsh = ssh
   user = inria
   machine1.domain.org
   machine2.domain.org
      user = vasy
   machine3.domain.org
      directory = /users/inria/distributor
</PRE><P>
Notice that the directive "<CODE>user = vasy</CODE>" applies to both <CODE>machine1</CODE> and <CODE>machine2</CODE>.
