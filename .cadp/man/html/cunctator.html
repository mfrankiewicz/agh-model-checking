<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#sect2">Description</A></H2>
<B>cunctator</B> (from the Latin,
the one who temporises) takes as input a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC),
expressed either as a BCG graph <I>spec</I><B>.bcg,</B> a composition expression <I>spec</I><B>.exp,</B>
an FSP program <I>spec</I><B>.lts,</B> an LNT program <I>spec</I><B>.lnt,</B> a LOTOS program <I>spec</I><B>.lotos,</B>
or a sequence file <I>spec</I><B>.seq.</B> <P>
<B>cunctator</B> performs an on-the-fly random simulation
of the CTMC, by a forward traversal of a transition sequence in the CTMC,
and computes, for certain specified transitions, their throughput at the
equilibrium ("steady-state"). The simulation terminates either when some
convergence criterion is met (see OPTIONS below), or when the user aborts
it (e.g., by typing a Ctrl-C). Upon termination of the simulation, the values
of the throughputs, accompanied by other simulation statistics, are displayed
on standard output. <P>
All transition labels of the CTMC must have one of the
following forms: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>"<CODE>rate</CODE> <I>%f</I>" (called a stochastic transition), </LI><P><LI type=disc>"<I>action</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate</CODE>
<I>%f</I>" (called a labelled stochastic transition), or </LI><P><LI type=disc>"<I>i</I>" (called an internal
transition), </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
where <CODE>%f</CODE> denotes a strictly positive floating-point number,
and <I>action</I> denotes a character string that does not contain the "<CODE>;</CODE>" character.
<P>
If the graph specified by <I>spec</I> also contains transition labels of other
forms than the aforementioned ones, these labels must be hidden or renamed
using the <B>-hide</B> and the <B>-rename</B> options (see OPTIONS below) in order to turn
<I>spec</I> into a CTMC. <P>
A state is called <I>stable</I> if it has no outgoing internal
transitions and is called <I>unstable</I> otherwise. <P>
The simulation algorithm used
by <B>cunctator</B> applies the notion of maximal progress: every time an unstable
state is encountered, all its outgoing stochastic transitions are ignored
and the simulation sequence is advanced along some of its outgoing internal
transitions. <P>
The CTMC is assumed not to contain nondeterminism, which means
that all internal transitions going out of an unstable state must lead
to states that are equivalent modulo stochastic branching bisimulation.
For efficiency reasons, <B>cunctator</B> does not attempt to perform this check,
but instead it displays among the simulation statistics whether potential
nondeterminism was encountered or not, i.e., whether a state having at least
two outgoing internal transitions was reached during simulation. The tool
also offers several ways of choosing internal transitions by means of the
<B>-scheduler</B> option (see OPTIONS below) in order to study whether they yield
the same throughputs (which indicates the possible absence of nondeterminism)
or not (which indicates the necessary presence of nondeterminism). <P>

models present in the literature.

The following options <I>cunctator_opt</I> are currently available:

<DL><DD><DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>-action</B> <I>action_1</I> ... <I>action_n</I> </DT>
<DD>Specify the actions contained in the labels of
stochastic transitions "<I>action_i</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate</CODE> <I>%f</I>" (for <CODE>1 &lt;= i &lt;= n</CODE>) of the CTMC for
which the throughput must be computed. All the stochastic transitions of
the CTMC having labels other than "<I>action_i</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate</CODE> <I>%f</I>" (for <CODE>1 &lt;= i &lt;= n</CODE>) are
considered as purely stochastic transitions (i.e., their actions are ignored
and only their rates are taken into account) during the simulation. If this
option is absent, the throughput is computed for all the actions contained
in the labels of stochastic transitions of the CTMC. <P>
To obtain useful results,
each of the actions <I>action_i</I> (for <CODE>1 &lt;= i &lt;= n</CODE>) must be contained in the label
of at least one stochastic transition of the CTMC. This can be ensured by
taking care that the options <B>-action</B>, <B>-hide</B>, and <B>-rename</B> are compatible. If
some action <I>action_i</I> is absent from the CTMC, its throughput will be always
equal to 0.0 regardless of the other parameters of the simulation. <P>
Note:
For efficiency reasons, it is recommended to use this option whenever the
actions for which the throughput must be computed are known. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-hide [ -total
| -partial | -gate ]</B> <I>hiding_filename</I> </DT>
<DD>Use the hiding rules defined in <I>hiding_filename</I>
to hide (on-the-fly) the labels of <I>spec</I>. See the <A HREF="caesar_hide_1.html"><B>caesar_hide_1</B></A>
 manual
page for a detailed description of the appropriate format for <I>hiding_filename</I>.
<P>
The <B>-total</B>, <B>-partial</B>, and <B>-gate</B> options specify the "total matching", "partial
matching", and "gate matching" semantics, respectively. See the <A HREF="caesar_hide_1.html"><B>caesar_hide_1</B></A>

manual page for more details about these semantics. Option <B>-total</B> is the
default. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-rename [-total|-single|-multiple|-gate]</B> <I>renaming_filename</I> </DT>
<DD>Use the renaming
rules defined in <I>renaming_filename</I> to rename (on-the-fly) the labels of <I>spec</I>.
See the <A HREF="caesar_rename_1.html"><B>caesar_rename_1</B></A>
 manual page for a detailed description of
the appropriate format for <I>renaming_filename</I>. <P>
The <B>-total</B>, <B>-single</B>, <B>-multiple</B>,
and <B>-gate</B> options specify the "total matching", "single partial matching",
"multiple partial matching", and "gate matching" semantics, respectively.
See the <A HREF="caesar_rename_1.html"><B>caesar_rename_1</B></A>
 manual page for more details about these
semantics.  Option <B>-total</B> is the default. <P>
As for the <A HREF="bcg_labels.html"><B>bcg_labels</B></A>
 tool,
several hiding and/or renaming options can be present on the command-line,
in which case they are processed from left to right. <P>
The hiding and renaming
options are useful for converting the transition labels of <I>spec</I> on-the-fly
in order to transform it into a CTMC. If (one of) these options and the
<B>-action</B> option are present on the command-line, the hiding and renaming options
will be applied before the <B>-action</B> option is taken into account. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-cache</B> <I>size</I>
<I>repl</I> </DT>
<DD>Trigger the use of an internal cache for storing at most <I>size</I> states
in order to speed up simulation by avoiding the recomputation of certain
sequences of internal transitions. When the cache is full and a new state
must be inserted in it, some other state present in the cache is deleted
and replaced by the new one. The choice of the state to be deleted is made
according to the replacement strategy <I>repl</I>, which can take one of the following
values: LRU (<I>Least Recently Used</I>), MRU (<I>Most Recently Used</I>), LFU (<I>Least
Frequently Used</I>), MFU (<I>Most Frequently Used</I>), and RND (<I>Random</I>). This option
can be used only for the schedulers 0 and 1 (see option <B>-scheduler</B> below).
By default, the size of the cache is 0 (i.e., no caching is performed during
simulation). Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-depth</B> <I>depth</I> </DT>
<DD>Specify the maximum number
of transitions of the sequence traversed during simulation. When the number
of transitions of the current simulation sequence becomes equal to the
natural number <I>depth</I>, then the simulation terminates and the statistics
are reported. A value 0 of <I>depth</I> means no limit, i.e., the simulation will
run for ever unless aborted by the user. The default value of <I>depth</I> is 0.
</DD><P>

<DT><B>-time</B> <I>time</I> </DT>
<DD>Specify the maximum simulation time, which is the sum of all
durations spent in the stable states of the transition sequence traversed
during simulation.  When the current simulation time (the sum of durations
spent in the stable states of the current simulation sequence) becomes
equal to or greater than the real number <I>time</I>, then the simulation terminates
and the statistics are reported. A value 0.0 of <I>time</I> means no limit, i.e.,
the simulation will run for ever unless aborted by the user. The default
value of <I>time</I> is 0.0. <P>
If both options <B>-depth</B> and <B>-time</B> are present on the command-line,
the option <B>-depth</B> is ignored in favor of <B>-time</B>. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-scheduler</B> <I>n</I> </DT>
<DD>Specify the way
an internal transition going out of an unstable state is chosen during
simulation in order to apply the notion of maximal progress. When the current
state has several outgoing internal transitions, choosing a particular
one as the next transition to be traversed amounts to model a particular
scheduler. The following values are currently available for the scheduler
<I>n</I>: <P>
- 0: Choose the first internal transition encountered while scanning
the transitions going out from the current state. <P>
- 1: Choose the last internal
transition encountered while scanning the transitions going out from the
current state. <P>
- 2: Choose randomly (with equal probability) one of the internal
transitions going out from the current state. <P>
This option enables the user
to experiment with several schedulers in order to study their effect on
the throughputs computed by simulation. Several simulations differing only
in the scheduler used and yielding the same throughputs indicate the possible
absence of nondeterminism in the CTMC. Two simulations differing only in
their scheduler and yielding different throughputs indicate the necessary
presence of nondeterminism in the CTMC. The default value of <I>n</I> is 0. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-rng</B>
<I>n</I> </DT>
<DD>Specify the random number generator used for computing the current simulation
time and to select the transitions of the simulation sequence. Four random
number generators are currently available (<I>n</I> = 0, 1, 2, 3). The default
value of <I>n</I> is 3. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-seed</B> <I>seed</I> </DT>
<DD>Specify the seed of the random number generator
used during simulation. The default value of <I>seed</I> is 1. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-rate</B> </DT>
<DD>Trigger the
CTMC simulation and computation of throughputs. <P>
Note: This option is currently
superfluous (if it is absent from the command-line, a warning message is
issued but the functioning of <B>cunctator</B> is unchanged), its current purpose
being to anticipate possible future extensions of the tool. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-save</B> <I>context_file</I>
</DT>
<DD>Save the context reached at the end of the current simulation in a binary
file <I>context_file</I>, which can be reused by a future invocation of <B>cunctator</B>
with the <B>-restore</B> option in order to start another simulation exactly from
the point at which the current simulation terminated.  Not a default option.
<P>
The context stored in <I>context_file</I> upon termination of the current simulation
includes the following information: the state of the CTMC, the number of
transitions of the sequence traversed during simulation, the simulation
time, and the state of the random number generator (which will be used
to restart the random number generator in the future invocations of <B>cunctator</B>
with <B>-restore</B> that reuse the context stored in <I>context_file</I>). The format
of <I>context_file</I> is undocumented and subject to future changes. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-restore</B> <I>context_file</I>
</DT>
<DD>Restore the context stored in <I>context_file</I> by a previous invocation of
<B>cunctator</B> with the <B>-save</B> option and start a new simulation from that context.
Not a default option. <P>
If option <B>-depth</B> is present on the command-line, the
current simulation will terminate according to the <I>depth</I> indicated by this
option. The number of new transitions explored during the current simulation
is equal to the difference between <I>depth</I> and the number of transitions
<I>d</I> of the sequence restored from <I>context_file</I>. In other words, the current
simulation will terminate when the total number of transitions traversed
during this simulation and during the previous simulation whose termination
context was stored in <I>context_file</I> becomes equal to <I>depth</I>. If <I>depth</I> &lt;= <I>d</I>,
then the current simulation terminates immediately and a warning message
is issued. Option <B>-time</B> is handled similarly. <P>
If the option <B>-action</B> is present
on the command-line, it is ignored in favor of the corresponding actions
restored from <I>context_file</I>. <P>
If the options <B>-seed</B> or <B>-scheduler</B> are present
on the command-line, they have higher precedence than the corresponding
values restored from <I>context_file</I>. This makes possible two kinds of simulation
scenarios: <P>
- One can perform a first simulation <I>sim1</I>, save its context <I>C</I>,
and start one or several simulations from <I>C</I>, but with seed and scheduler
parameters different than those of <I>sim1</I>. This is useful, e.g., when the <I>sim1</I>
simulation is intended to go over some initial "transient" behaviour of
the system, after which several simulations, with different seed and scheduler
parameters, can be performed in order to study the "steady" behaviour of
the system. <P>
- If one must ensure that the former simulation whose termination
context is stored in <I>context_file</I> is a proper prefix of the current simulation,
then the options <B>-seed</B> and <B>-scheduler</B> must be absent from the command-line.
In this way, a simulation <I>sim1</I> terminating in context <I>C</I> followed by a simulation
<I>sim2</I> starting from <I>C</I> yields the same results as a single simulation <I>sim</I>
having the same seed and scheduler as <I>sim1</I> and having the same termination
conditions (depth or time) as <I>sim2</I>. <P>
If the options <B>-hide</B> or <B>-rename</B> were present
on the command-line of the previous invocation of <B>cunctator</B> which produced
<I>context_file</I>, they must also be present (with exactly the same arguments)
on the command-line of the current invocation of <B>cunctator</B> in order to ensure
that the former simulation is a proper prefix of the current simulation.
<P>
Note: When the options <B>-save</B> and <B>-restore</B> are simultaneously present on the
command-line, they can use the same file <I>context_file</I>. This file will be
first read in order to restore the context from which the current simulation
is started, then rewritten upon termination of the simulation in order
to save the context reached at that point. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-verbose</B> </DT>
<DD>Animate the user's screen,
telling what is going on. Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-version</B> </DT>
<DD>Display the current
version number of the tool and stop. To be effective, this option should
occur as the first argument on the command line. Subsequent options and/or
arguments, if any, will be discarded. Not a default option. </DD><P>

The tool was developed and documented by Radu Mateescu (INRIA/VASY),
with the advice of Holger Hermanns (INRIA/VASY). It is derived from the
<I>generator</I> tool of CADP, developed by Hubert Garavel (INRIA/VASY). Meriem
Zidouni (Bull and INRIA/VASY) suggested various improvements (such as the
computation of throughputs for several actions) concerning the prototype
version 0.5 of the tool.
