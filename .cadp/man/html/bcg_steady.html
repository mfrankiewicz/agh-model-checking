<H2><A NAME="sect2" HREF="#sect2">Description</A></H2>
<B>bcg_steady</B>
performs steady-state analysis on <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B>, which is an (extended) continuous-time
Markov chain encoded in the BCG format. <P>
<B>bcg_steady</B> first transforms <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B>
into a numerical matrix indexed by states. Then, it reduces this matrix
by normalizing probabilistic transitions, removing unreachable states and
"vanishing" states, keeping "tangible" states only (see section INPUT below
for details about the BCG graphs accepted by <B>bcg_steady</B> and the definition
of tangible and  vanishing states). As a result, the reduced matrix obtained
is the generator matrix of a continuous-time Markov chain. Finally, <B>bcg_steady</B>
computes the corresponding equilibrium ("steady-state") probability distribution
on the long run using the Gauss/Seidel algorithm (see e.g. [Ste94]). It can
also compute throughputs for the transitions of the system. 
<H2><A NAME="sect3" HREF="#sect3">General Options</A></H2>
The
following <I>bcg_options</I> are currently supported: <B>-version</B>,  <B>-create</B>, <B>-update</B>,
<B>-remove</B>, <B>-cc</B>, and <B>-tmp</B>. See the <A HREF="bcg.html"><B>bcg</B></A>
 manual page for a description of
these options. 
<H2><A NAME="sect4" HREF="#sect4">Particular Options</A></H2>
Taking as input <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B>, on the form
of which various restrictions apply (see section INPUT below), <B>bcg_steady</B>
can produce five kinds of output files, depending on the command-line options
specified. <P>
The optional list of "<I>parameter</I>=<I>value</I>" arguments at the end of
the command-line (where <I>parameter</I> is any character string that neither contain
blanks nor the "=" character, and where <I>value</I> is any character string that
does not contain blanks) is only meaningful to option <B>-thr</B>. These arguments
have no influence on the actual numerical computations, they only serve
to add columns in throughput tables (see section OUTPUT-2 below). <P>
The following
options are supported: 
<DL><DD><DL COMPACT>

<DT><B>-epsilon</B><I>&nbsp;eps</I> </DT>
<DD>Set the precision of certain floating-point
comparisons to <I>eps</I>, where  <I>eps</I> is a real value. When <I>eps</I> is out of [0..1[,
<B>bcg_steady</B> reports an error. Default value for <I>eps</I> is 1E-6. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-sol</B><I>&nbsp;<I>solution_file</I></I>
</DT>
<DD>Write the probability vector, computed at the equilibrium state, to file
 <I>solution_file</I> (see section OUTPUT-1 below for a description of the file
format). If <I>solution_file</I> already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
If <I>solution_file</I> is equal to the special string `-', the probability vector
is displayed on the standard output.  Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-thr</B><I>&nbsp;[<B>-append</B>]&nbsp;<I>throughput_file</I></I>
</DT>
<DD>Write the transition throughputs, computed at the equilibrium state, to
file <I>throughput_file</I>. The format of this file is determined by the suffix
(i.e., file extension) of <I>throughput_file</I> (see section OUTPUT-2 below for
a description of the available file formats). If <I>throughput_file</I> already
exists, its contents will be overwritten, unless the <B>-append</B> option is specified,
in which case the transition throughputs will be added at the end of <I>throughput_file</I>
so as to form a proper data table. If the <B>-thr</B> option is missing or if <I>throughput_file</I>
is equal to the special string `-', the transition throughputs are displayed
on the standard output. Option "<B>-thr -</B>" is the default option when the command
line does not contain any of the following options: <B>-mat</B>, <B>-red</B>, <B>-sol</B>, and
<B>-thr</B>. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-mat</B><I>&nbsp;<I>matrix_file</I></I> </DT>
<DD>Write the transposed "raw" matrix (prior to matrix reduction)
to file  <I>matrix_file</I>. The format of this file is determined by the suffix
(i.e., file extension) of <I>matrix_file</I> (see section OUTPUT-3 below for a description
of the available file formats). If <I>matrix_file</I> already exists, its contents
will be overwritten. If <I>matrix_file</I> is equal to the special string `-', the
matrix is displayed on the standard output. Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-red</B><I>&nbsp;<I>reduced_matrix_file</I></I>
</DT>
<DD>Write the reduced transposed matrix to file <I>reduced_matrix_file</I>. The format
of this file is determined by the suffix (i.e., file extension) of <I>reduced_matrix_file</I>
(see section OUTPUT-3 below for a description of the available file formats).
If <I>reduced_matrix_file</I> already exists, its contents will be overwritten.
 If <I>reduced_matrix_file</I> is equal to the special string `-', the matrix is
displayed on the standard output. Not a default option. </DD><P>

<DT><B>-log</B><I>&nbsp;<I>log_file</I></I> </DT>
<DD>Write
various information about data structures and computations to file <I>log_file</I>.
The format of this file is undocumented but self-understandable, and might
change in future releases of <I>bcg_steady</I>. If <I>log_file</I> already exists, its
contents will be overwritten. If <I>log_file</I> is equal to the special string
`-', information is displayed on the standard output. Not a default option.
</DD><P>
</DL></DD><P></DL>
<P>
The files <I>solution_file</I>, <I>throughput_file</I>, <I>matrix_file</I>, <I>reduced_matrix_file</I>,
and <I>log_file</I> should be pairwise different; otherwise, the result is undefined.

<H2><A NAME="sect5" HREF="#sect5">Input: the BCG Graph</A></H2>
The input of <B>bcg_steady</B> is an extended Markovian model
combining features from discrete-time and continuous-time Markov chains. In
order to be accepted by <B>bcg_steady</B>, <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B> must satisfy several conditions,
otherwise an error message will occur. All transition labels of <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B>
must have one of the following forms: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>"<CODE>rate</CODE> <I>%f</I>" (called a stochastic transition),
</LI><P><LI type=disc>"<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate</CODE> <I>%f</I>" (called a labelled stochastic transition), </LI><P><LI type=disc>"<CODE>prob</CODE> <I>%p</I>" (called
a probabilistic transition), or </LI><P><LI type=disc>"<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;prob</CODE> <I>%p</I>" (called a labelled probabilistic
transition),  </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
where <CODE>%f</CODE> denotes a strictly positive floating-point number,
<CODE>%p</CODE> denotes a floating-point number in the range ]0..1],  and <I>label</I> denotes
a character string that does not contain the "<CODE>;</CODE>" character (<I>label</I> may be
equal to the internal action, often noted "i" or "tau"). <P>
Note: transitions
labelled with only "<I>label</I>" are always forbidden by <B>bcg_steady</B>, including
the case where "<I>label</I>" denotes the internal action. <P>
When constructing the
"raw" matrix, all <I>label</I>s occurring in labelled probabilistic transitions
are discarded. <P>
If there exists a (labelled) probabilistic transition from
a state <I>S1</I> to a state <I>S2</I>, then all (labelled) stochastic transitions from
<I>S1</I> to any state (including <I>S2</I>) are discarded when constructing the "raw"
 matrix. This reflects that probabilistic transitions are instantaneous,
while stochastic transitions are not. <P>
We classify states as being either
<I>vanishing</I> if at least one (possibly labelled) probabilistic transition
goes out of these states, or <I>tangible</I> otherwise.  <P>
The input BCG graph should
contain at least one tangible state, and it should not contain cycles (including
self-loops) of states connected by (possibly  labelled) probabilistic transitions.
<P>
Note: The sum of <CODE>%p</CODE> values on all (possibly labelled) probabilistic transitions
leaving a vanishing state needs not be equal to 1; if this sum is different
from 1, then probabilistic values will be normalized (i.e., divided by this
sum). <P>
To build the reduced matrix, <B>bcg_steady</B> eliminates all vanishing states,
so that this matrix contains tangible states only.  The input BCG graph
should be such that, after reduction, each tangible state possesses at
least one outgoing transition (i.e., there is no deadlock state). <P>
See also
<A HREF="bcg_min.html"><B>bcg_min</B></A>
 for a discussion about the various probabilistic and stochastic
models present in the literature. 
<H2><A NAME="sect6" HREF="#sect6">Output-1: the Solution Vector</A></H2>
The format
of the file generated using the <B>-sol</B> option of <B>bcg_steady</B> is the following.
There is one line per tangible state. Each line contains two numbers: an
integer corresponding to the state number in the input BCG graph and a
real number corresponding to the probability of being in this state on
the long run (i.e., at the equilibrium). 
<H2><A NAME="sect7" HREF="#sect7">Output-2: the Transition Throughputs</A></H2>
<P>
The
throughput table has two (possibly empty) groups of columns: 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>The first
group contains one column for each option <I>parameter</I>=<I>value</I> given on the
command-line. These columns, if any, are useful when evaluating the performance
of a system parameterized with one or more variables, namely to aggregate
in the same table the different throughputs measures corresponding to different
values of the parameters. Columns of the first group appear in the same
order as the corresponding options on the command-line.  </LI><P><LI type=disc>The second group
contains one column per labelled stochastic transition label present in
the input BCG graph, precisely, one column for each different <I>label</I> occurring
on a transition of the form  "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>". </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
The throughput table starts
with a first "header" line followed by one or several "subsequent" lines.

<UL>
<LI type=disc>The header line contains the "titles" of columns. For a column of the first
group associated to a <I>parameter</I>=<I>value</I> option, the corresponding title is
<I>parameter</I>. For a column of the second group associated to a label, the corresponding
title is the label itself. </LI><P><LI type=disc>The subsequent lines contain values. For a column
of the first group associated to a <I>parameter</I>=<I>value</I> option, the corresponding
cell contains <I>value</I>. For a column of the second group associated to a <I>label</I>,
the corresponding cell contains the throughput for this label, i.e., the
sum, for each stochastic transition "<I>label</I><CODE>;&nbsp;rate&nbsp;%f</CODE>", of the rate value <I>%f</I>
weighted with the probability of being in the tangible source state of
this transition, in the long run. </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
If the <B>-append</B> option is absent, or if
the throughput file is equal to the special string `-', or if the throughput
file does not exist, or if it is empty, <I>bcg_steady</I> will generate automatically
the header line and one single subsequent line. <P>
Otherwise, the first line
of the throughput file is expected to contain the titles of columns and
will be parsed to identify the correspondance between labels and columns.
In particular, <B>bcg_steady</B> checks that the first group of columns corresponds
to the parameters given on the command-line. After parsing the header line,
<B>bcg_steady</B> will append one single subsequent line at the end of the throughput
file. As regards the second group of columns, if the label of a given column
title does not occur in <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B>, a zero throughput will be reported
in the corresponding column; conversely, labels of <I>filename</I><B>.bcg</B> for which
there is no corresponding column title will be ignored. <P>
Throughputs can
be displayed in two different formats, which are determined according to
the suffix (i.e., file extension) of the throughput file name. 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>If the file
name has the "<B>.csv</B>" extension, the throughput table will be displayed in
the CSV (Comma-Separated Values) exchange format understood by most relational
data base applications and spreadsheet software (such as Microsoft Excel,
etc.). </LI><P><LI type=disc>Otherwise, if the file name has a different extension, or no extension,
or if it is the standard output, throughputs will be displayed in a human-readable
format that is essentially the same format as CSV with commas replaced
by spaces so as to align columns properly. Note that this format is also
understood by some data visualization tools such as Gnuplot. </LI><P>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="sect8" HREF="#sect8">Output-3: the
(transposed) Matrices</A></H2>
Both the (transposed) "raw" matrix produced using
option <B>-mat</B> and the (transposed) reduced matrix produced using option <B>-red</B>
follow the same format conventions. The essential difference is that the
former contains vanishing and tangible states, whereas the latter only
contains tangible states. Also, the reduced matrix is a generator of a continuous-time
Markov chain. <P>
For two different indexes <I>i</I> and <I>j</I>, the element (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>) of the
matrix, located at the <I>i</I>-th row and the <I>j</I>-th column, is the sum of all the
floating-point numbers associated to the (labelled) stochastic or probabilistic
transitions going from the <I>j</I>-th state to the <I>i</I>-th  state, where floating-point
numbers associated to (labelled) stochastic  transitions are interpreted
as positive numbers whereas floating-point numbers associated to (labelled)
probabilistic transitions are interpreted as negative numbers between -1
and 0. Note that rates and probabilities are never mixed since, between
two states, there cannot be stochastic and probabilistic transitions at
the same time. <P>
The diagonal elements (<I>j</I>,<I>j</I>) are defined to be the negative
sum  of all matrix elements (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>) with <I>i</I> different from <I>j</I>. <P>
Matrices can
be displayed in three different formats, which are determined according
to the suffix (i.e., file extension) of the matrix file name. 
<UL>
<LI type=disc>If the file
name has the "<B>.csv</B>" extension, the matrix will be displayed in the CSV (Comma-Separated
Values) format mentioned above. Each raw of the matrix is displayed on one
line of the output file, and on each line, the matrix elements are separated
with commas. </LI><P><LI type=disc>If the file name has the "<B>.spm</B>" extension, the matrix will be
 displayed in the format used by the Sparse 1.3 software library (see the
CREDITS section below). This format is the following.  The first line of
the file contains the file name. The second line contains the number of
states, followed by the "<CODE>real</CODE>" keyword.  Then, there is one line per each
non-zero element (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>) in the matrix. Each line contains two integers followed
by one real number: the value of <I>i</I>, the value of <I>j</I>, and the value of matrix
element (<I>i</I>,<I>j</I>). The file ends with a "sentinel" line consisting of three
zeros.  <BR>
 </LI><P><LI type=disc>Otherwise, if the file name has a different extension, or no extension,
or if it is the standard output, the matrix will be displayed in a human-readable
format. The columns of the matrix are split into "packets" so that the text
fits on the size of the display. The indexes of rows and columns are indicated
and null elements of the matrix are displayed as "..." instead of "0". Statistics
(such as matrix size, density, etc.), are displayed after the  matrix. </LI><P>
</UL>
<P>
Note:
for graphs with many states, whatever the chosen matrix format, the matrix
files can be large and writing them to disk may take time.

The first version of
<B>bcg_steady</B> was written by Christophe Joubert  (INRIA/VASY) and Holger Hermanns
(Saarland University and University of Twente). The algorithm for steady-state
analysis is based on a former implementation by Vassilis Mertsiotakis (University
of Erlangen). Bruno Ondet (INRIA/VASY) ported the tool to various architectures.
David  Champelovier and Hubert Garavel (both at INRIA/VASY) deeply revised
the  <B>bcg_steady</B> code and manual page to allow their integration within
CADP. Holger Hermanns and Frederic Lang (INRIA/VASY) proof-checked the manual
page. 
<H2><A NAME="sect12" HREF="#sect12">Credits</A></H2>
<B>bcg_steady</B> uses (an extended version of) the Sparse 1.3 package
from the University of California, Berkeley, developed by Kenneth S. Kundert
under the supervision of Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli.
