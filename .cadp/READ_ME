Distributed Processes) software developed at INRIA (Institut National 
de Recherche en Informatique et Automatique, France).

The CADP software and its use are subject to terms and conditions
stated in a software agreement. For commercial users, the software 
agreement is the contract that has been signed between INRIA and your

CREDITS (1) : SYNTAX
--------------------

The `caesar', `caesar.adt', `caesar.indent', `exp2c', `mcl_expand',
`svl_kernel', and `xtl' tools are developed using the SYNTAX compiler-
generator system and embody portions of SYNTAX code as well as portions
of code generated by SYNTAX. The SYNTAX system is developed at INRIA and
is available at the following Web site: http://syntax.gforge.inria.fr/

  The source code of SYNTAX is distributed with two different licenses, 
  depending on the files:
  - the recursive content of src/ and incl/ and the non-recursive content 
  of SYNTAX's root directory are distributed under the CeCILL-C license;
  - the recursive content of all other repertories is distributed under the
  CeCILL license;
  All code produced by SYNTAX must be considered as being under the CeCILL-C 
  license.

CREDITS (11) : BLAT
-------------------

The `installator' tool of CADP invokes a Windows executable named BLAT, which
is a Windows NT console utility to send the contents of a file in an e-mail
message using the SMTP protocol.

  COPYRIGHT - License to use Blat

  The authors of Blat have placed it in the public domain.  This means you
  can use it free of charge for any purpose you like, with nearly no
  conditions being placed on its use by us.  The source code is also
  available free of charge and under the same conditions as the executables.

  You have permission to modify, redistribute, hoard, or even sell Blat in its
  executable or source form. If you do sell Blat, though, we'd appreciate it if
  you'd provide your own support (and send us a free copy).  We cannot take any
  support load for Blat (we've got better things to do).

  The only limitation we impose is that blat not be used to send unsolicited
  commercial email.  Use of this software to send unsolicited commercial
  email constitutes an agreement to pay the authors $10,000.

  Various bits of the source code are copyright by other people/organizations.
  Look in the source code for copyright ownership.

  The authors and contributors of the package are not responsible for any damage
  or losses that the usage of Blat may cause. We are especially not responsible
  for the misuse of the SMTP (or other) mail system.
